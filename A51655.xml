         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Learned Treatiſe of the Famous <hi>Malebranch</hi> begs the Favour of your Lordſhips Patronage, and if any thing could do ſo, would almoſt deſerve it. All great Genius's are nearly related to one another, at leaſt there is a ſort of Sympathy between them; and the Wits of <hi>France</hi> have never fail'd of a kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception from thoſe in <hi>England,</hi> which the moſt Cruel Wars cannot hinder, nor does Love to our Country forbid us from doing Juſtice to theirs. The Tranſlation of good <hi>French</hi> Books into our Tongue, is a Repriſal on their Nation, who have taken the ſame way by ſuch Writings as are Famous in Antiquity, doing all that was in their Power for an Univerſal Language, perhaps to make way for Univerſal Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. So that Tranſlation from them again, is only a Countermining them, and Fencing with them at their own Weapons: And this perhaps might ſucceed as well in our Language as any in <hi>Europe,</hi> ſince 'tis much
<pb facs="tcp:60613:3"/>fuller and ſtronger, and conſequently capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of mending an Original; and indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hinder it, but <hi>want of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from Men in Power,</hi> or <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Performance.</hi> For the <hi>Firſt,</hi> there is no one that can juſtly complain of it, who has the Ambition of placing the Name of <hi>Normanby</hi> before his Writings, it gives him a new Soul, and he ought nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to think or write meanly when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders at whoſe Altars his Labours are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. For the <hi>Second,</hi> I have as little to ſay for it, as I could wiſh our Criticks may have to ſay againſt it: The Errors that have eſcap'd the Preſs in the Original, the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Subject, the Confinement of Language for fear of ſpoiling the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to gratifie the Gentleman, my own neceſſary Avocations, and the very little time I did it in, cannot promiſe ſo correct a Tranſlation, as perhaps it otherwiſe might have been, yet I am willing to believe, it may in ſome meaſure be uſeful to ſuch as can read it without Prejudice; and it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd by the Author, only for ſuch as are willing to know the Errors of their Senſes and Imagination, and the Weakneſs of the Humane Mind, in order to diſcover Truth and Happineſs, I cannot be very uneaſie about anticipating its Fate amongſt others, eſpecially under your Lordſhips Protection.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:60613:3"/>
            <p>Indeed I may very well be Ambitious and Proud of ſuch a Protection, when the Government begins to be ſo very Senſible of the Happy Influences of your great Abilities and Intereſt. 'Tis a rare Happineſs to have Prudence in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, joyn'd with Bravery in Action: Nay the ſame Man may be a Politick-General, and Maſter of much Perſonal Valour, yet be far enough from an Accompliſh'd Stateſman: But to think coolly, yet act warmly, to ſeize and improve every Advantage, and yet pierce into the Depths of Futurity, and diſintangle intricate and diſtant Cauſes and Effects, are only Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments for ſuch a King as ours, and ſuch a Miniſter of State as your Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Nor are your great Abilities to ſerve the Publick Good, without particular Inſtances of your Perſonal Hazards and Signal Zeal for its Preſervation in the late <hi>Dutch Wars,</hi> when your Lordſhip was pleaſed to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the <hi>Royal Catherine,</hi> a Poſt that was the greateſt Evidence of your Lordſhips Loyalty and Bravery.</p>
            <p>The higheſt Military and Civil Honours, which require great Application, hinder not your Lordſhip from excelling in the leſs Severe Studies, a great Genius will do beſt upon whatever Employment it fixes it ſelf, witneſs your Lordſhips <hi>Eſſay on Poetry,</hi> and that admirable Product of your Youth,
<pb facs="tcp:60613:4"/>
               <hi>the Temple of Death,</hi> with ſeveral other Miſcellany Pieces of your Lordſhips, which like our great <hi>Roſcommon</hi>'s Works, have a particular noble Air, that is not only the Effect of a great Genius, but alſo of a Genteel and Happy Education, and therefore unimitable by our beſt Wits, who can only plead the former Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Nor is it any Wonder that ſo great a Maſter ſhould Patronize others who have excell'd in the ſame Divine Art, which requires that force of Spirit and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Thought, that are neceſſary to all, that even in Proſe ſhall do any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, or worthy the Peruſal of ſuch Judges as your Lordſhip; this, <hi>Malebranch</hi> is allow'd by all to have in his Native Langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and therefore if he gives your Lordſhip no Entertainment, the Defect muſt be in the Tranſlation, not the Original; the very Faults of this great Man have ſomething in them extreamly Beautiful, and the Jewel is ſo dazling, that the flaws are ſcarce diſcern'd. The inſcribing theſe Papers to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips moſt honorable Patronage, is the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this Addreſs, wherein I have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to teſtifie both to your Lordſhip and the World, with how profound a Deference and Reſpect, I am,</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Mind of Man is by its Nature, as it were, ſituated between its Creator and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Creatures; ſince according to
<note n="*" place="margin">Nihil eſt potentius illâ Creaturâ, quae mens dicitur rationalis, nihil eſt ſublimius. Quidquid ſupra illam eſt, jam Creator eſt. <hi>Tr.</hi> 23. <hi>upon St.</hi> John.</note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> there is nothing above it but God alone, and nothing below it but Bodies: But as the great Elevation it has above all Material things, does not hinder it from being united to <hi>them,</hi> and from depending in ſome meaſure upon a Portion of Matter; ſo the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance that is between the Sovereign Being and the Mind of Man, does not hinder it from being immediately and in a very ſtrict manner united to <hi>him.</hi> This laſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion raiſes it above all things; it gives it Life, Light, and all its Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; and
<note n="*" place="margin">Quod ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionali a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimâ me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius eſt omnibus conſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entibus Deus eſt. <hi>Aug.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion in many Paſſages of his Works, as of that which is the moſt Natural and the moſt Eſſential to the Mind: On the contrary, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Mind with the Body, debaſes Man exceedingly, and is the Principal Cauſe of all our Errors and Miſeries.</p>
            <p>I do not wonder that the common ſort of Men, or that the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> ſhould only conſider in the Soul, its Retation and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Body, without diſtinguiſhing its Relation and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with
<pb facs="tcp:60613:5"/>God: But I am ſurpriſed that Chriſtian Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, who ſhould prefer the Mind of God to the Mind of Man, <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to ſome wretched Commentator upon a Heathen Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, ſhould look upon the Soul rather as the <hi>Form</hi> of the Body, than as being made after the Image, and for the Image of God, that is, according to
<note n="*" place="margin">Ad ipſam ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem non omnia facta ſunt, ſed ſola ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia rationalis. Quare omnia per ipſam, ſed ad ipſam non niſi anima rationalis. Itaque ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia rationalis &amp; per ipſam facta eſt, &amp; ad ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam: Non enim eſt ulla natura interpoſita. <hi>Lib. Imp. de Gen. ad Litt.</hi>
               </note> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> for <hi>Truth,</hi> to which alone it is immediately united. It is true the Soul is united to the Body, and is naturally the <hi>Form</hi> of it; but it is alſo true, that it is united to God after a much stricter and more Eſſential manner. The relation it has to its Body might not be; but the relation it has to God is ſo Eſſential, that it is impoſſible to conceive that God could create a Spirit without that Relation.</p>
            <p>It is evident that God can only Act for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; that he can only Create Spirits to <hi>Know</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> him; that he can neither give them any Knowledge, nor imprint any Love in them, but what is for him, and what tends towards him: But he was not oblig'd to unite Spirits to Bodies as he has done. Therefore the
<note n="*" place="margin">Rectiſſimè dicitur factus ad imaginem &amp; ſimilitudinem Dei, non enim aliter incommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilem veritatem poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet mente conſpicere. <hi>De vera Rel.</hi>
               </note> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which our Minds have to God, is Natural, Neceſſary, and abſolutely Indiſpenſible; but the Relation of our Spirits to our Bodies, though Natural, is neither abſolutely Neceſſary, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible.</p>
            <p>This is not a proper place to ſet forth all the Authorities and Reaſons, which may induce us to believe, that it is more ſuitable to the Nature of our Mind to be united to <hi>God,</hi> than to a <hi>Body;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:60613:5"/>theſe things would lead us too far. To place this Truth in a juſt Light, it would be neceſſary to deſtroy the Principal Foundations of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophy, to explain the Diſorders of Sin, to engage what is falſly called Experience, and to argue againſt the Prejudices and Illuſions of the Senſes. Therefore to make the common ſort of Mankind apprehend this Truth perfectly, is too hard a Task to attempt in a Preface.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs it is not difficult to prove it to attentive Minds, which are acquainted with true Philoſophy; for it is enough to put them in mind, that ſince the Will of God regulates the Nature of every thing, it is more ſuitable to the Nature of the Soul to be united to God by the Knowledge of Truth, and the Love of Good, than to be united to a <hi>Body;</hi> ſince it is certain, as above, that God has created Spirits to <hi>Know,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> him, rather than to <hi>Inform</hi> Bodies. This Proof is able at firſt ſight to ſtartle Ingenious Minds, then to render them attentive, and laſtly to convince them: But it is morally Impoſſible, that Senſualiz'd Spirits, who can know nothing but what is felt ſhould ever be convinc'd by ſuch Arguments. Theſe ſort of Men muſt have groſs ſenſible Proofs, becauſe nothing ſeems real to them, unleſs it makes an Impreſſion upon their Senſes.</p>
            <p>The Fall of the first Man, has ſo much weakned the
<note n="*" place="margin">Mens, quod non ſentit, niſi cum puriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima &amp; beatiſma eſt, nulla Cohaeret, niſi ipſi veritati, quae ſimilitudo &amp; Imago patris, &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientia dicitur. <hi>Aug. lib. Imp. de Gen. ad Litt.</hi>
               </note> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of our Mind with God, that none but thoſe are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it whoſe Heart is purified, and whoſe Mind is inlightned; for this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion ſeems Imaginary to all thoſe who blindly follow the Judgments of the Senſes, and the Motions of the Paſſions.</p>

            <p>On the contrary, it has ſo much ſtrengthned the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of our Soul with our Body, that theſe two parts of our ſelves ſeem to us to be no longer but one and the ſame Subſtance; or rather it has made us ſuch Slaves to our Senſes and Paſſions, that we are inclin'd to believe our Body is the Principal of the two Parts of which we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the different Employments of Men, we have a great deal of reaſon to believe, that they have a mean and low Opinion of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for as they all love Felicity, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of their Being, and only labour to make themſelves Happier or more Perfect, have we not reaſon to believe, that they have a greater Value for their Body, and the <hi>Goods</hi> of their Body, than for their Mind, and the <hi>Goods</hi> thereof, when we ſee them commonly imploy'd about things that have a Relation to the Body, ſeldom or never thinking on thoſe which are abſolutely neceſſary for the Perfection of the Mind?</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of Men labour with ſo much Induſtry and Toil, only to maintain a miſerable Life, and to leave their Children ſome neceſſary Conveniencies for the Preſervation of their Bodies.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who by the good Fortune, or Chance of their Birth, are not ſubject to this Neceſſity, do not ſhew better by their Buſineſs and Imployments, that they look upon their Soul as the nobleſt part of their Being: Hunting, Dancing, Gaming, Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments are their common Imployments; their Soul being a Slave to their Body, Eſteems and Cheriſhes all thoſe Divertiſements, though altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nworthy of it; but becauſe their Body has a relation to all Senſible Things, the Soul is not only
<pb facs="tcp:60613:6"/>inſlav'd to the Body, but alſo to all ſenſible things by the Body, and for the Body; for 'tis by the Body that Men are united to their Relations, their Friends, their Country, their Imployments, and to all ſenſible Enjoyments, the Preſervation of which ſeems to them as neceſſary and as valuable as the Preſervation of their own Being. Thus the Care of their Eſtates, and the Deſire of increaſing them; the Paſſion of Glory and Grandeur agitates and imploys them infinitely more than the perfecting of their Soul.</p>
            <p>Moreover the Learned, and thoſe who pretend to Wit, ſpend more than half their Life in Actions purely Animal, or ſuch as incline us to think, that they value their Health, their Eſtate, and their Reputation, more than the Perfection of their Mind. They ſtudy more to attain a Chimerical Grandeur, in the Opinion of other Men, than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Power and Capacity of their Mind. They make their Heads a kind of Wardrobe, in which they Store up, without choice or order, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bears any Character of Learning; I mean, whatever may appear Rare and Extraordinary, and excite the Admiration of other Men. They are proud of being like thoſe Cabinets of Curioſity and Antiquity, which have nothing Rich or Solid in them, the Value whereof only depends on Fancy, Paſſion and Chance; and they ſeldom labour to improve their Mind, and to regulate the Motions of their Heart.</p>
            <p>Yet it is not that Men are wholly Ignorant they have a

               </note> Soul, and that this Soul is the chief part of their Being. They have alſo been convinc'd a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times by Reaſon and Experience,
<pb facs="tcp:60613:7"/>that it is no very conſiderable Advantage, to have ſome Reputation, Riches, and Health for ſome Years; and generally that all the Advantages of the Body, and ſuch as are only poſſeſs'd by the Body, and for the Body, are Imaginary and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhable Goods: Men are ſenſible that it is better to be Juſt than Rich; to be Reaſonable than Learned; to have a lively penetrating Mind, than a quick and active Body. Theſe Truths can never be effac'd out of their Mind; and they diſcover them Infallibly, whenever they are pleas'd to think on them. <hi>Homer,</hi> for inſtance, who praiſes his Hero for his Nimbleneſs in Running, might have obſerv'd (if had ſo pleas'd) that it is a Praiſe fit for Horſes and Grey-hounds. <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſo Famous in Hiſtory for his Illuſtrious Thefts, had ſometimes the ſame Reproaeches from his Reaſon, as Murtherers and Thieves have, notwithſtanding the confuſed Noiſe of the Flatterers that were about him.

For it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Mind can only be immediately united to God; I mean, the Mind only depends truly on God; and if it be united to the Body, or if it depends on it, it is becauſe the Will of God efficaciouſly cauſes that Union or that Dependance. This will be eaſily apprehended by the Sequel of this Work.</note> The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of our Mind with our Body is the ſame: This <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes by degrees, as that which we have with God increaſes; but it is never quite diſſolv'd but by our Death: For though we were as much enlightned, and as much above the Pleaſures of Senſe as the Apoſtles were; yet it is neceſſary ſince the Fall, that our Mind ſhould depend on our Body, and that we ſhould feel the Law of our Fleſh, continually reſiſting and oppoſing the Law of our Mind.</p>
            <p>The Mind becomes Purer, Stronger, more Perſpicuous, and more inlarged, proportionably as its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with God increaſes; for 'tis he from whom it derives all its Perfection. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it becomes Corrupted, Blind, Weak, and is contracted by degrees, as the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion which it has with its Body Increaſes and Strengthens; becauſe that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion alſo cauſes all its Imperfections. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Man who judges of all things by his Senſes, who follows the Motions of his Paſſions in all things, who perceives nothing but what he feels, and who loves nothing but what flatters him, is in the moſt wretched Diſpoſition of Mind that he can poſſibly be in: In that condition he is at a vaſt diſtance from Truth, and from his Good. But
<pb facs="tcp:60613:8"/>when a Man only judges of things by the pure

            <p>God never deceives thoſe who interrogate him by a ſerious Application, and by an entire Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Mind towards him, though they do not always hear his Anſwers; but when the Mind, removing from God, diffuſes it ſelf Externally, when it only Interrogates the Body to learn Truth, hearkning only to its Senſes, its Imagination and Paſſions which continually ſpeak to it, it muſt needs be deceiv'd.

<pb facs="tcp:60613:10"/>enough to believe it upon my word, nor to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of it by the Luſtre of a Tranſitory Light; they must know it by many Experiences, and many undeniable Demonſtrations: Theſe things muſt never be in danger of being effaced out of their Mind, they muſt ever be preſent to it in all their Studies, and other Imployments of their Life.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who will give themſelves the Trouble to read the Work with ſome Application which is here publiſh'd, will, if I am not deceiv'd, commence ſuch a Diſpoſition of Mind; for we have demonſtrated in it the different ways wherein our Senſes, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and Paſſions, are abſolutely uſeleſs, to the diſcovery of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Good:</hi> On the contrary, that they dazle and ſeduce us on all occaſions; and generally that all the Knowledge the Mind receives by the Body, or by ſome inward Motions of the Body, are all falſe and confuſed, in reſpect of the Objects they repreſent; although they are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful towards the Preſervation of the Body, and of the Goods which have relation to the Body.</p>
            <p>Several Errors are engaged in it, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly thoſe that are moſt univerſally receiv'd, or that occaſion the greateſt Diſorder of the Mind; and we ſhew that moſt of them proceed from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the Mind with the Body. We deſign in ſeveral places to make the Mind ſenſible of its Servitude, and of the Dependance it has on all ſenſible things, that it may awake from its Drowſineſs, and make ſome Efforts for its Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>
            <p>We do not only make a bare Expoſition of our Errors, but alſo explain the Nature of the Mind: We do not, for inſtance, inſiſt upon a great Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of all the particular Errors of the Senſes
<pb facs="tcp:60613:10"/>or Imagination, but upon the Cauſes of thoſe Errors. We ſhew at once (in the Explanation of theſe Faculties and general Errors, to which we are ſubject) an almoſt infinite Number of thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Errors into which Men fall. Thus the ſubject of this Work is the whole Mind of Man; we conſider it in it ſelf, in relation to the Body, and in relation to God; we examine the Nature of all its Faculties, and obſerve the uſes we ought to make from hence to avoid Error. Laſtly, We explain moſt of thoſe things we thought uſeful to advance in the Knowledge of Man.</p>
            <p>The fineſt, the moſt agreeable, and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Knowledge, is undoubtedly the Knowledge of our ſelves. Of all Humane Sciences, the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Man is the moſt worthy of Man: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that Science is not the moſt cultivated or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd Science we have: The common ſort of Mankind neglects it wholly; even among thoſe that value themſelves upon Sciences, there are but few that apply themſelves to it, and there are yet fewer who ſucceſsfully apply themſelves to it. Moſt of thoſe who are eſteem'd Learned in the World, have but a confuſed Knowledge of the Eſſential Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that is between the Mind and Body. St.
<note place="margin">Conf. Book 4. Chap. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf, who has diſtinguiſh'd thoſe two Beings ſo well, confeſſes that it was a long time before he could know it. And though it muſt be granted, that he has explain'd the Properties of the Soul and Body better than any of thoſe that were before him, and who have ſucceeded him, until our Age; yet it were to be wiſh'd, that he had not attributed to External Bodies, all the Senſible Qualities which we perceive by their means; for indeed they are not clearly contain'd in the Idea he had of Matter.
<pb facs="tcp:60613:11"/>So that one may confidently ſay, That the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Mind and the Body has not been known clearly enough till of late Years.</p>
            <p>Some fancy they know the Nature of the Mind: Others are perſwaded that it is impoſſible to know any thing about it. The greateſt part of Men are inſenſible of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and for that reaſon they deſpiſe it. But all theſe common Opinions are rather Effects of the Imagination and Inclination of Men, than the Conſequences of a clear and diſtinct Sight of their Mind: It is becauſe they are loath to look within themſelves, there to diſcover their Weakneſſes and Infirmities, but they delight in curious Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and fine Sciences; never looking within themſelves, they are inſenſible of the Diſorders that happen there; they think they are well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are inſenſible; they find fault with thoſe, who knowing their own Diſtemper apply Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to it; and ſay, that they make themſelves Sick, becauſe they endeavour to cure themſelves.</p>
            <p>But theſe great Genius's, who penetrate into the moſt myſterious Secrets of Nature; who in their Mind aſcend into the Heavens, and who deſcend even into the Abyſs, ought to remember what they are: Theſe great Objects perhaps only ſerve to dazle them: The Mind muſt go out of it ſelf to attain to ſo many things, but it cannot do it without being diſſipated.</p>
            <p>Men are not born to become Aſtronomers, or Chymiſts, to ſpend all their Life in gazing through a Teleſcope, or in Sweating at a Furnace; in order to infer little inſignificant Conſequences from their Laborious Obſervations. I grant that an Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer was the firſt that diſcovered Lands, Seas,
<pb facs="tcp:60613:11"/>and Mountains in the Moon; that he was the firſt that obſerv'd Spots in the Sun, and exactly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their Motions: I grant that a Chymiſt hath at laſt found the Secret of fixing <hi>Mercury,</hi> or making the <hi>Alkaiſt,</hi> by which <hi>Vanhelmont</hi> boaſted he could diſſolve all Bodies; but are they become the Wiſer or the Happier for this? They may have got ſome Reputation by it in the World; but if they have conſider'd it, that Reputation has only increaſed their Servitude.</p>
            <p>Men may look upon Aſtronomy, Chymiſtry, and moſt Sciences, as proper Divertiſements for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; but they ought not to ſuffer themſelves to be deluded by them, nor to prefer them to the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Man; for the Imagination fixes a certain Idea of Grandeur upon Aſtronomy, becauſe that Science conſiders great Objects, glorious Objects, Objects which are infinitely above all that are about us; the Mind ought not blindly to embrace that Idea: We ſhould make our ſelves Judges and Maſters of it, and diveſt it of that ſenſible Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which aſtoniſhes our Reaſon. The Mind ought to judge of all things according to its Internal Knowledge, without hearkning to the falſe and confuſed Teſtimony of the Senſes and Imagination; and if it examines all Humane Sciences by the pure Light of Truth which guides it, we dare affirm, that it will deſpiſe moſt of them, and will have more reſpect for that which teaches us what we are, than for all others whatever.</p>
            <p>Therefore we chuſe to adviſe thoſe who are Lovers of Truth, to judge of the Subject of this Work, according to the Anſwers they will receive from the Sovereign Maſters of all Men, after having made their Application to him by ſerious Reflection, rather

            <p>Becauſe we are perſwaded that Men cannot teach each other; and thoſe that hear us do not learn the Truths we ſpeak to their Ears, unleſs he that has diſcover'd them to us, reveal them at the ſame time to their Mind, we find our ſelves oblig'd to adviſe thoſe who will profitably read this Work, not to believe us upon our word out of Inclination, nor to oppoſe what we ſay out of Averſion: For though we

            <p>We are, Thanks be to God, far from being guilty of this way of proceeding, though we are often accuſed of it: We deſire, indeed, that Men ſhould believe the Facts and Experiences we relate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe things cannot be learn'd by the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Mind to the Sovereign and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Reaſon.

               </note> Reaſon, we expreſly adviſe them not to rely upon what we think of them; for we judge it no ſmall Crime for a Man to compare himſelf to God, by thus uſurping Authority over the Mind.</p>
            <p>The chief reaſon that we have for deſiring thoſe who ſhall read this Work, to apply themſelves ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to it, is, That we are willing to be made ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Faults we may have committed in it, for we do not pretend to Infallibility. The Mind has ſo ſtrict a relation to the Body, and has ſo great a Dependance on it, that we may reaſonably fear we have not always clearly diſtinguiſh'd the confuſed Noiſe of the Imagination, from the pure Voice of Truth which ſpeaks to the Mind.</p>
            <p>Did God only ſpeak, and did we only judge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what we hear, we might perhaps uſe theſe words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:
<note n="*" place="margin">Sicut audio ſic ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dico, &amp; jucicium meum juſtum eſt, quia non quaero voluntatem me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am. <hi>Joan.</hi> Ch. 5.30.</note> I Judge according to what I hear, and my Judgment is Juſt and True.</hi> But we have a Body which ſpeaks lowder than God himſelf, and that Body never ſpeaks Truth: We have Self-love, which corrupts
<pb facs="tcp:60613:13"/>the Words of him who always ſpeaks Truth: And we have Pride, which inſpires us with Boldneſs, to judge without hearkning to the Words of Truth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which only we ought to judge: For the principal Cauſe of our Errors is, That our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments extend themſelves further than the clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Mind. Therefore I deſire thoſe to whom God ſhall diſcover my Miſtakes, to make me ſenſible of them, that this Work, which I only give as an Eſſay, (whoſe ſubject is very worthy of Mens App<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ication) may be perfected by degrees.</p>
            <p>I had only undertaken it at firſt with a deſign to inſtruct my ſelf, but ſome Perſons having thought that it might be uſeful for the Publick, I willingly conſented to publiſh it, the rather becauſe one of the chief reaſons they gave me for it, did ſuit with the deſire I had to be uſeful to my ſelf. The real way, ſaid they, to be inſtructed in any Matter, is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Sentiments about it to ſome Learned Men. It excites our Attention and theirs: Sometimes they have Truths which are unknown to us; and ſometimes they go through certain Diſcoveries which we have neglected out of Inadvertency, or have abandon'd for want of Courage and Power.</p>
            <p>It was vpon this Proſpect of my particular Benefit, and that of ſome others, I venture to be an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but that my hopes may not prove vain, I give this Advice, that Men ſhould not be diſguſted at firſt, if they find things that contradict the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinions that are generally approv'd of by all Men and in all Ages. The Errors I endeavour to deſtroy, are thoſe that are moſt general: If Men were very much enlighten'd, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would be a reaſon, but 'tis quite contrary. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let it be well remembred, that Reaſon only ought
<pb facs="tcp:60613:13"/>to preſide in the Judgment of all Humane Opinions, which have no relation to Faith, which God only inſtructs us in after a very different manner from that by which he diſcovers natural things to us. Let Men look within themſelves, and draw near unto the Light which ſhines there continually, that their Reaſon may be the more illuminated. Let them carefully avoid the Senſations which are too lively, and all the Emotions of the Soul which take up the Capacity of the Mind: For the leaſt Noiſe, the leaſt Appearance of Light, often diſſipates the ſight of the Mind: It is good to avoid all thoſe things, though it is not abſolutely neceſſary. And if in uſing our utmoſt

                  </argument>
                  <p>ERROR is the Cauſe of Man's Miſery, the corrupt Principle that has produc'd <hi>Evil</hi> in the World; 'tis this, which begets and cheriſhes in our Souls all the Evils that afflict us, and we can never expect a true and ſolid
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60613:18"/>Happineſs, but by a ſerious Endeavour to avoid it.</p>
                  <p>Holy Scripture teaches us, that Men are miſerable, only becauſe they are Sinners and Criminals, and they would be neither, if they did not make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Slaves of Sin by <hi>aſſenting to Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be true then, that Error is the Origin of Men's Miſery, how very juſt is it, that they ſhould endeavour their Deliverance from it? and certainly an Effort towards it would not be vain and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, though perhaps it might not have all the effect that could be deſired; admit we could not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at Infallibility, and accompliſh an abſolute Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, yet we ſhould be leſs deceiv'd, and ſubject to fewer Evils; We are not to expect an entire Felicity in this Life, becauſe we cannot pretend to Infallibility; but our Endeavours to avoid Error muſt be as conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual as are our Averſions for Miſery. In a word, as we earneſtly deſire Happineſs without Hopes of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it here, ſo we muſt vigorouſly purſue Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility without any preſent Pretenſions to it.</p>
                  <p>We ought not to imagine any great Toyl in an <hi>Enquiry after Truth,</hi> 'tis but opening our Eyes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming attentive, and exactly obſerving the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Book</hi> VI.</note> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Rules. Exactneſs of Thought has not that Trouble and Slavery in it, that the Imagination repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents; Nay, though we ſhould meet ſome little Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs at firſt, yet the attending Satisfaction will abundantly recompence our Pains; for, in fine, 'tis that which produces Light, and diſcovers Truth.</p>
                  <p>But to ſpend no more time in preparing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's mind to a <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> which we are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to believe is already ſufficiently diſpos'd thereto, let us examine the Cauſes and Nature of our Errors; And ſince the Method of examining things in their Original is more regular and clear, and helps us to a deeper Knowledge of them than any other Proceſs, let us Eſſay to put it in practice here.</p>
                  <p>The Mind of Man having nothing of <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Extenſion</hi> in it,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Nature and Properties of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </note> is, undoubtedly, a ſimple and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Subſtance, and without any Compoſition of parts, yet it has been uſual to make a diſtinction of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60613:18"/>two Faculties in it, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> (which we ſhall ſoon explain) for it ſeems the Notions or Idea's that Men have of them, are not ſo clear and diſtinct, as they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe theſe Idea's are very abſtract, and not the proper Objects of the Imagination, perhaps it will not be amiſs to expreſs them by their Relation to thoſe Properties, which are agreeable to <hi>Matter,</hi> which being eaſie to be imagin'd, will render the Notions, which 'tis fit to apply to theſe Expreſſions, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> more diſtinct and familiar to us; We muſt only take heed to remember, that theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations betwixt <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Matter</hi> are not truly ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate, and that the Compariſon of theſe different kinds of Beings ſerve only to make the Mind more attentive, and, as it were, ſenſible of the Subject we Diſcourſe upon.</p>
                  <p>Matter or Extenſion includes in it two Properties, <hi>Receptibility of different Figures,</hi> and <hi>Capability of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> even ſo the Mind of Man has two Faculties, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> which is receptible of different Idea's, and <hi>Will,</hi> which is capable of different Inclinations, or of willing different things. We ſhall explain in order the Relation that the firſt Property of <hi>Matter</hi> has to the firſt Faculty of the <hi>Mind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Extenſion is capable of receiving two ſorts of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, <hi>External,</hi> as Roundneſs in a piece of Wax, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal,</hi> as that which is proper to all the Particles whereof the Wax is compos'd; for 'tis certain, that all the Particles which make up a piece of Wax, are very different in Shape from thoſe which compoſe a piece of Iron; I call then, for diſtinction ſake, that ſimply a <hi>Figure,</hi> which is <hi>External,</hi> and that <hi>Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is <hi>Internal,</hi> and which is neceſſary to all the Particles whereof the Wax is compos'd, ſo as to be what it is. Thus alſo the Idea's of the Soul are of two Sorts, (taking the name Idea in general for every thing that the Mind immediately perceives) the firſt repreſents ſomething without us, as that of a Square, a Houſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſecond, that which paſſes within us, as Senſation, whether of Grief, Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60613:19"/>we ſhall ſee hereafter, that theſe laſt Idea's are nothing elſe but a Manner of the Mind's Exiſtence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall call them the <hi>Modifications</hi> of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>We might alſo call the Inclinations of the Soul the Modifications thereof; For 'tis evident, that the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Will is a Manner of the Souls Exiſtence, and therefore it might be call'd the Modification of Soul, as motion in Bodies, being a Manner of their Exiſtence, might be call'd a Modification of Matter. However I neither call the Inclinations of the Will, nor Motions of Matter, <hi>Modifications;</hi> ſince theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and theſe Motions have, ordinarily, relation to ſomething External; for the Inclinations have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>Good,</hi> and Motions have relation to <hi>ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Body.</hi> But the Figures and Configurations of Bodies, and the Senſations of the Soul, have no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary relation to any thing without; For even as a Figure is round, when all the External parts of a Body are equally diſtant from the Center without any relation to things External, ſo all the Senſations, of which we are capable, could ſubſiſt, if there were no Object without us, their Exiſtence includes no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary relation to Bodies which ſeem to cauſe them, as ſhall be proved elſewhere; and they are nothing elſe but the Soul modified after ſuch or ſuch a manner, ſo that they are properly the <hi>Modifications</hi> of the Soul; I ſhall then take the Liberty to call them ſo, to explain my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and principal agreement betwixt that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, that matter has of reſerving different Figures and different Configurations, and that Faculty which the Soul has of receiving different Idea's, and different Modifications, is this, even as the Property of receiving different Figures and different Configurations is entirely paſſive and includes no action, ſo alſo the Faculty of receiving different Idea's and different Modifications in the Mind is entirely paſſive and includes no action: I call this Faculty or Capacity, which the Soul has of receiving all things, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDERSTANDING.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whence we muſt conclude, that 'tis the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which perceives, ſince there is nothing elſe that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60613:19"/>receives the Idea's of Objects, for 'tis the ſame thing for the Soul to perceive an Object, as to receive the Idea which repreſents it. 'Tis alſo the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which perceives the Modifications of the Soul; for I mean by the word, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> that paſſive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the Soul, by which it receives all the different Modifications whereof it is capable; For 'tis the ſame thing to the Soul to receive that manner of Exiſtence, which is call'd Pain, as to perceive Pain; ſince it can receive Pain no other way but by perceiving it; whence we muſt conclude, that 'tis the Underſtanding which imagines abſent Objects, and perceives thoſe that are preſent, and that the Senſe and Imagination are only the Underſtanding, perceiving Objects by the Organs of the Body, as ſhall be explain'd here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, when Men feel Pain, or any thing elſe, they perceive it ordinarily, by the means of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Senſe, they commonly ſay, that 'tis the Senſes which perceive it, without knowing diſtinctly what they mean by the Term <hi>Senſe;</hi> they fancy there's ſome Faculty, diſtinct from the Soul, which makes it, of the Body capable of feeling, for they believe the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Senſe do really participate of our perceptions. They imagine, that the Body does ſo far aſſiſt the Mind to perceive, that if the Mind was ſeparated from the Body it could perceive nothing at all: But theſe thoughts are the effects of Prejudice, and of judging according to our preſent State of Life, in which we perceive nothing without the Help of the Organs of Senſe, as ſhall be explain'd more at large. 'Tis to accommodate my ſelf to the common way of ſpeaking, that I ſhall ſay hereafter <hi>the Senſes perceive,</hi> but by the word <hi>Senſe</hi> I only mean that paſſive Faculty of the Soul juſt mention'd; that is, the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perceiving ſomething by means of what paſſes in in the Organs of the Body according to the Inſtitution of Nature, as ſhall be elſewhere explain'd.</p>
                  <p>Another agreement between the paſſive Faculty of the Soul and that of Matter, is, that as Matter is not truly chang'd by an alteration of its Figure; for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60613:20"/>Inſtance, Wax receives no conſiderable Change for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round or ſquare, ſo the Mind receives no Change by the Diverſity of Idea's which it has; I mean, the Mind receives no conſiderable Change, although it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an Idea of a Square, or a Circle, in perceiving a Square, or a Circle.</p>
                  <p>Farther, as it may be ſaid, that Matter undergoes conſiderable Changes, when it looſes the Configuration proper to the parts of the Wax, to receive that which is proper to Fire and Smoke, when the Wax is chang'd into Fire and Smoke; ſo it may be ſaid, that the Soul receives very conſiderable Alterations, when it changes its Modifications, and ſuffers Pain, after having felt Pleaſure. Whence we muſt conclude, that Idea's are to the Soul very near, what Figures are to Matter; and that Configurations are much the ſame to Matter, that Senſations are to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>There are yet other agreements betwixt the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Configurations of Matter, and the Idea's and Modifications of the Mind, for it ſeems that Matter is an Image of the Mind; I only mean, there are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties in Matter, which have betwixt themſelves Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, much like thoſe which are found amongſt the Properties belonging to the Mind, although the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Mind is very different from that of Matter, as ſhall be clearly ſhewn hereafter.</p>
                  <p>From all that I have ſaid, I would have it well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that by the Underſtanding, I mean that paſſive Faculty, which the Soul has of perceiving, that is, of receiving not only different Idea's, but alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Senſations, even as Matter is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all Manner of External Figures and Internal Configurations.</p>
                  <p>The other Property of Matter is, that 'tis capable of receiving ſeveral Motions, and the other Faculty of the Soul is, that 'tis capable of receiving ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, let us compare theſe together.</p>
                  <p>As the Author of Nature is the Univerſal Cauſe of all Motions, which are found in Matter, ſo is He alſo the General Cauſe of all the Natural Inclinations in our Minds, and even as all Motions are made in a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60613:20"/>Streight Line, if they do not meet with ſome particular and foreign Cauſes, which determine and change them into Curve Lines, ſo all the Inclinations we receive from God, are right, and could not have any other End but the poſſeſſion of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> were there not ſome Extraneous Cauſe which determines the Impreſſion of Nature towards evil ends: Now 'tis this foreign Cauſe, which is the Origin of all our <hi>Evils,</hi> and which Corrupts all our Inclinations.</p>
                  <p>To underſtand this well, we muſt know, that there is a very conſiderable Difference betwixt the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Motion, which the Author of Nature produces in Matter, and the Impreſſion or Motion towards Good in General, which the ſame Author of Nature continually Impreſſes on the Mind; for Matter is wholly unactive, it has no power to ſtop it's Motion, or to determine or turn it ſelf, one way rather than another: Its motion, as I have ſaid before, is made always in a Strait Line, and when diverted from this motion, it deſcribes a Curve, the neareſt to a right line that's poſſible, becauſe 'tis God that impreſſes on it its Motion, and regulates its Determination. But 'tis not to with the Will;
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> it may be ſaid in one ſenſe to be active, and to have in it ſelf a Power of determining differently the Inclination or Impreſſion that God gives it, for tho' it cannot ſtop this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, it may in a ſenſe be ſaid to turn it which way it pleaſes, and thereby cauſe all the diſorders, that are in its Inclinations, and all the Miſeries, which are the certain and neceſſary Conſequences of Sin.</p>
                  <p>So that by the Word <hi>WILL,</hi> I wou'd be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood to mean, <hi>the Natural Impreſſion or Motion, which carries us towards indetermin'd and univerſal Good:</hi> And by the Word <hi>LIBERTY,</hi> I only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>the Power which the Mind has of turning that Impreſſion towards agreeable Objects, and ſo ſixing our natural Inclinations on ſome particular Object, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were looſe and indetermin'd to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Good;</hi> that is, to God, who comprehends in himſelf all that's Good,</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60613:21"/>
                  <p>Whence 'tis eaſie to diſcover, that tho' our Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclinations are voluntary, yet they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways free with that Liberty of Indifference, that I am ſpeaking of, which includes the Power of <hi>Willing</hi> or not <hi>Willing,</hi> or of Willing the contrary to what our Natural Inclinations carry us; for tho' 'tis vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and freely that Men love Good in General, ſince they can't love againſt their Will, and 'tis a Contradiction to ſuppoſe the Will ſhould ever ſuffer Conſtraint, however they love it not <hi>freely</hi> in the ſenſe that I have juſt explain'd, ſince 'tis out of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of our Will not to wiſh to be Happy.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt be well obſerv'd, that the Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as puſh'd on towards Good in General, can't determine its Motion towards a particular Good, if the ſame Mind, conſider'd as ſuſceptible of Idea's, has not the Knowledge of this particular Good; that is, in the common way of ſpeaking, the Will is a blind Power, which can only deſire thoſe things that the Underſtanding repreſents to it: So that the Will can't differently determine the Impreſſion it has for Good, and all its Natural Inclinations, but by commanding the Underſtanding to repreſent to it ſome particular Object. The Power then that the Will has of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining its Inclinations, neceſſarily includes an ability of carrying the Underſtanding towards agreeable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. I will explain by an Example, what I have ſaid concerning <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Liberty.</hi> A Man repreſents to himſelf a Preferment under the Notion of a Good, which he can hope for; immediately the Will wills this Good, that is, the Impreſſion, that the Mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually receives towards Indetermin'd and Univerſal Good, inclines it to this Preferment: But as this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment is not the Univerſal Good, and is not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in a clear and diſtinct view of the Mind, as Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Good, (for the Mind never ſees clearly that which is not) the Impreſſion, that he had receiv'd of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Good,</hi> is not wholly ſtopt by this particular <hi>Good,</hi> the Mind has ſome motion to go yet farther, it is not neceſſarily nor invincibly in Love with this Dignity, but is at Liberty in reſpect thereof.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60613:21"/>Now its Liberty conſiſts in this, that being not fully convinc'd that this Dignity includes all the <hi>Good,</hi> which he is capable of loving, he may ſuſpend his Judgment and Love, and afterwards (as ſhall be explain'd in the third Book) he may, by the Union which he has with the Univerſal Being, or that which includes every Good, think of other things, and conſequently love other <hi>Goods.</hi> In fine, we may compare all other Goods, love 'em according to the Order and Degree in which they are lovely, and refer 'em to <hi>him,</hi> which includes them all, and which is only worthy to limit our Love, as being only able to fill all our Capacity of Loving.</p>
                  <p>Almoſt the ſame thing may be ſaid of the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Truth, as of the Love of Good; We love the Knowledge of Truth as the Enjoyment of Good, by a Natural Impreſſion; and this Impreſſion, as well as that which carries us towards Good, is not invincible, its only ſo by the evidence, or by the perfect and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute knowledge of the Object: And we are as free in our falſe Judgments, as in our irregular Affections, as ſhall be ſhown in the following Chapter.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT might well be concluded,
<note place="margin">Of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reaſonings.</note> from what has been ſaid in the preceeding Chapter, that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding never judges, ſince it only perceives; or ſince Judgments and Reaſonings, even in reſpect of the Underſtanding, are only pure Perceptions: 'Tis the Will alone which properly Judges in acquieſcing in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60613:22"/>that which the Underſtanding repreſents to it, and in voluntarily reſting there, 'tis this alſo which deceives us; but theſe things muſt be explain'd more at large.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then, there is no Difference in reſpect of the Underſtanding, between a ſimple Perception, and a Judging and Reaſoning, ſave, that the Underſtanding perceives a ſimple thing by a ſimple Perception, without any relation to any thing whatever; that it perceives the relation betwixt two or more things in Judging; that, in fine, it perceives the relations that are betwixt the relations of things in reaſoning. So that all the operations of the Underſtanding are <hi>pure Perceptions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When we perceive, for Example, twice 2 or 4, this is only a <hi>Simple Perception:</hi> When we Judge that 2 times 2 are 4, or that 2 times 2 are not 5, the Underſtanding does only yet receive the relation of Equality which is between 2 times 2 and 4, or the relation of Inequality that is between 2 times 2 and 5. Thus the <hi>Judgment,</hi> in reſpect of the Underſtanding, is only <hi>the Perception of the Relation between two or more things;</hi> but <hi>Reaſoning</hi> is <hi>the Perception of the Relation that is found</hi> (not between two or more things, for this would be Judgment, but) <hi>between two or more Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of two or more things.</hi> Thus, when I conclude that 4 is leſs than 6, and that 2 times 2 making 4, is alſo conſequently leſs than 6, I perceive not only the Relation of Inequality between 2 times 2 and 6, for then this would be only Judging, but the Relation of Inequality which is betwixt the Relation of 2 times 2 and 4, and the Relation between 4 and 6, which is Reaſoning. The Underſtanding then only perceives, and the Will only judges and reaſons by reſting it ſelf voluntarily in what the Underſtanding repreſents to it; as we ſaid before.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That Judgments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Will.</hi>
                     </note> when thoſe things that we conſider are ſelf evident, it appears to us, that it is not then vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily that we aſſent to them; ſo that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to believe, that 'tis not our Will, but Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which judges of them.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60613:22"/>
                  <p>But to be convinc'd of our Error, we muſt know, that things which we conſider, are only then entirely evident, when the Underſtanding hath examin'd them on all ſides, and all their neceſſary relations, in order to judge of them; whence it happens, that as the Will can will nothing without knowing, ſo it cannot act on the Underſtanding: I mean, it can't deſire that it ſhould repreſent any new thing in its Object, becauſe it has already conſider'd it in every reſpect, by which it has any Relation to the propoſed Queſtion: the Will is then oblig'd to acquieſce in that, which the Underſtanding has already repreſented, and to trouble or agitate it no farther; and this acquieſcing is that, which is properly call'd Judgment and Reaſoning. And thus, this Acquieſcence or Judgment not being free, when things are in their utmoſt evidence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us to be involuntary.</p>
                  <p>But ſo long as there is any thing obſcure in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that we conſider, or that we are not entirely aſſur'd that we have diſcover'd all, that is neceſſary to reſolve the Queſtion, as it frequently happens in ſuch as are very difficult, and include many Relations; we are at our Liberty not to conſent, and the Will can yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Underſtanding to apply it ſelf to a new Enquiry; hence we are not ſo far from believing, that the Judgments, we form upon theſe Subjects, are voluntary.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, the greateſt part of Philoſophers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, that even theſe Judgments, which we form upon obſcure things, are involuntary, and will generally have it, that a conſent to <hi>Truth</hi> is an action of the Underſtanding, which they call <hi>Aſſenſus,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from a Conſent to <hi>Good,</hi> which they attribute to the Will, and which they call <hi>Corſenſus.</hi> But the Cauſe of their Diſtinction and Error is this, That in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent State of Life, we often ſee evident <hi>Truths</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon of Doubt, and ſo the Will is not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in the Conſent that it gives to them, as we have explain'd above: But 'tis not the ſame thing as to <hi>Good,</hi> we know nothing of it, without having ſome reaſon of doubting whether we ought to love it; our Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60613:23"/>and the Inclinations which we Naturally have for ſenſible Pleaſures, are confus'd Reaſons, yet very ſtrong, becauſe of the Corruption of our Nature, and they make us cold and indifferent even in the Love of God. And thus, we evidently perceive our Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and are inwardly convinc'd that we make uſe of our Liberty, when we love God.</p>
                  <p>But we do not in like manner perceive that we uſe our Liberty, when we conſent to Truth, eſpecially when it appears Self-evident; and this makes us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our Conſent to Truth is involuntary, as if it were neceſſary that our actions were indifferent to be voluntary, and as if the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> did not love God vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily without being interrupted by ſomething elſe, juſt as we conſent to this evident Propoſition,
<note place="margin">Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians love not Truth, but the knowledge of Truth, altho' the contrary is commonly aſſerted.</note> twice 2 is 4, without being hindred from believing it by ſome appearance of a contrary Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>But, that we may diſtinctly perceive the Difference that there is betwixt the Wills conſent to a <hi>Truth,</hi> and its conſent to <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> we muſt know the Difference that is betwixt Truth and Goodneſs, taken in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon acceptation, and in relation to us. The Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence conſiſts in this. Goodneſs concerns and affects us, but Truth affects us not, for Truth conſiſts only in the relation that two or more things have between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but Goodneſs conſiſts in the relation of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs that things have with us. Hence there's but one Action of the Will in reſpect of Truth, which is its Acquieſcence, or Aſſent, to the Repreſentation of the relation that is between things; But in reſpect of Goodneſs there are two, its Acquieſcence or Aſſent to the relation of Agreement that things have with us, and its Love or Motion towards ſuch a thing; which actions are very different, altho' they are ordinarily confounded, for there's much difference betwixt ſimply acquieſcing in, and being carry'd by Love to what the Mind repreſents, ſince Men often acquieſce in things, which they could wiſh were not, and which they do.</p>
                  <p>Now, if we conſider well of things, we ſhall plainly perceive that 'tis the Will always that aſſents not to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60613:23"/>things, unleſs they be diſagreeable to it, but to the Repreſentation of things, and the Reaſon why the Will acquieſces in things, which are in their utmoſt Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is, (as we have already ſaid) becauſe there is not in thoſe things any Relation which ought to have been conſider'd, that the Underſtanding hath not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. So that it is, as it were, neceſſary for the Will to leave off Debating, and unprofitably Fatiguing it ſelf, and reſt in full Aſſurance, that it is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, ſince there's nothing yet farther, upon which it can exerciſe its Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>We muſt chiefly remark, that in the State we now are, we have only an imperfect Knowledge of things; and by conſequence, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary that we have this Liberty of Indifference, by which we may forbear giving our Aſſent.</p>
                  <p>To ſee the Neceſſity of it, we muſt conſider that we are carry'd by our Natural Inclinations towards Truth and Goodneſs, ſo that the Will inclining it ſelf only to ſuch things, as the Mind has ſome knowledge of, it muſt carry it ſelf to that, which has the appearance of Truth and Goodneſs; but becauſe every thing, which has the appearance of Goodneſs, is not always what it appears to be, its evident that if the Will were not free, and if it were infallibly and neceſſarily carry'd to every thing, that has theſe appearances of Goodneſs and Truth, it would very often be deceiv'd; whence it ſeems we might conclude, that the Author of its Being was alſo the Author of its Wandrings and Errors.</p>

                     <note place="margin">III. <hi>Of the Uſe that we must make of Liberty, that we may never be deceiv'd.</hi>
                     </note> that we might keep our ſelves from being deceiv'd, and from all the Evils which are the effect of our Errors, by never yielding a full Aſſent to appearances of Truth, but only to Truth it ſelf, that is, in continually applying the Mind, and commanding it to Examine, till it has clear'd and reſolv'd every thing that was to be Examin'd; For Truth is ſcarce ever without Evidence, and Evidence conſiſts only in a clear and diſtinct view of all the Parts and Relations of the Object, which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to give an aſſur'd Judgment.</p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60613:24"/>
                  <p>The Uſe then, that we muſt make of our <hi>Liberty,</hi> is, TO USE IT AS MUCH AS WE CAN; that is, Never to conſent to any thing whatever, till we are compell'd to it, as it were by the inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of our Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>To ſubmit to falſe Appearances of Truth, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave our ſelves againſt the Will of God, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves fairly to the ſecret Reproaches of our Reaſon, which follow our not aſſenting to Evidence, this is to obey the Voice of Eternal Truth. Here are then the two eſtabliſh'd Rules, which I ſpoke of, which are very neceſſary in all Speculative and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sciences, and which we ought to look upon, as the Foundation of all Humane Sciences.</p>
                  <p>The firſt,
<note place="margin">General Rules to avoid Sin.</note> which relates to Sciences, is this; <hi>Never to give an entire aſſent, but to Propoſitions that appear ſo evidently true, that we can't refuſe them without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inward regret, and ſecret reproaches of our Reaſon;</hi> that is, without we knew clearly that we ſhould make an ill uſe of our Liberty, if we would not aſſent, or would extend our Power to things, over which we have none.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, which reſpects Morality, is this; <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to love any Good, abſolutely, if we can without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe forbear.</hi> Whence it follows, that we ought to love nothing abſolutely, and without relation to any thing elſe, but God, for 'tis he only, from the Love of whom we can't abſtain without this ſort of Remorſe; that is, without an evident knowledge of our doing ill, ſuppoſing him known by Reaſon and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt obſerve here,
<note place="margin">Neceſſary reflections upon theſe General Rules.</note> that when thoſe things that we perceive do appear very probable to us, we find our ſelves extreamly inclin'd to believe them; nay, we are uneaſie, when we are not perſwaded of them; ſo that if we are not very cautious, we are in much danger of aſſenting to them, and conſequently of deceiving our ſelves; for 'tis a great chance that Truth is exactly like to Probability. Hence it is that I have expreſsly laid down in theſe Rules, that we muſt conſent to nothing but what we ſee evidently,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60613:24"/>unleſs we ſhould make an ill uſe of our Liberty, if we did not conſent.</p>
                  <p>Now, altho' we perceive our ſelves extreamly inclin'd to aſſent to an appearance of Truth, yet if we take care to examine whether we evidently ſee our ſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to conſent thereto, we ſhall find the contrary; for if appearance of Truth is grounded upon the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our Senſes, I ſay, an appearance of Truth, falſely ſo called, then we ſhall be ſtrongly inclin'd to comply therewith, not perceiving any other Cauſe than ſome Paſſion, or General Affection, that we have for that which pleaſes the Senſes, as will fully appear hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But, if an appearance of Truth ariſes from ſome Conformity with Truth, as commonly all probable Knowledge, taken in a certain ſenſe, is true, then if we reflect upon our ſelves, we ſhall perceive that we are inclin'd to two things, <hi>viz.</hi> to <hi>Believe,</hi> and to <hi>Examine yet farther,</hi> but we ſhall never find our ſelves ſo much perſwaded, as to think we do ill, if we do not abſolutely aſſent.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe two Inclinations, which we find in us, in reference to Probabilities, are very good, for we can, and muſt aſſent to apparent Truths, ſo far as they bear the Image of Truth; however, we muſt not yet intirely aſſent, according to the Rule before laid down, but thorowly examine the Object, that we may have a perfect knowledge of its Nature, truly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between Truth and Falſhood, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards intirely ſubmit, if Evidence compells us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.</p>
                  <p>We ought much to accuſtom our ſelves to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Truth and appearance of Truth, by an inward Examination of our ſelves, as I have already ſaid; for 'tis for want of this ſort of Examination, that we perceive our ſelves touch't after the ſame manner with two things ſo different. For indeed 'tis a matter of the greateſt Conſequence to make Good uſe of our Liberty, by denying always nor A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>en to things, or loving them, till we find our ſelves compell'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the powerful Voice of the Author of Nature,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60613:25"/>which I before call'd the Reproaches of our Reaſon, and the Regret of our Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>All the Duties of Spiritual Beings, as well of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels as of Men, conſiſts chiefly in this Practice, and it may poſitively be affirm'd, that, if they carefully uſe their Liberty, and not blindly enſlave themſelves to Lies and Vanity, they are in the way to the greateſt perfection, that they are capable of; provided they ſuffer not their Underſtanding to lie idle, but carefully and continually excite it to new Knowledge, rendring it capable of the greateſt Truths, by conſtant medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations upon ſuch Subjects as are worthy their appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>To perfect our Minds, it's not ſufficient to uſe our Liberty always, ſo as to aſſent to nothing, as ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do, who pride themſelves in knowing nothing, but doubting all things; nor muſt we ſo aſſent to every thing, as many others, who fear nothing ſo much as being ignorant of ſomething, and pretend to know all things; but we muſt make a Good uſe of our <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> by continual Meditations, ſo that we may have frequent Opportunities of being able to aſſent to what it propoſes without fear of being deceiv'd.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is not very difficult to divine, that the practice of the firſt Rule, which I ſpoke of in the preceeding Chapter, will not pleaſe all the World, but eſpecially thoſe imaginary Learned, who pretend to know all things, and yet know nothing at all, pleaſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſpeaking confidently of the moſt difficult things, and who certainly are ignorant of the moſt eaſie.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60613:25"/>
                  <p>They will not fail to ſay with <hi>Artiſtotle,</hi> that Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is only to be found in Mathematicks, but in Morality and Phyſics Probability ſuffices; That <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> was very much out in treating of Phyſics, as he did of Geometry, which was the reaſon he fail'd in the attempt; That 'tis impoſſible for Man to know Nature, That it's Springs and Secrets are impenetrable to the Humane Mind; and many other fine things, which they ſet off with a great deal of Pomp and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence, maintaining it from the Authority of a multitude of Authors, and value themſelves much upon knowing their Names, and being able to cite ſome Paſſages from them.</p>
                  <p>I would intreat theſe Gentlemen to talk no more of what they profeſs they do not know, and put a Check to the ridiculous Motions of their Vanity, in forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to compoſe ſuch great Volumes upon thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which, according to their own Confeſſion, they are ignorant of.</p>
                  <p>But let theſe Perſons ſeriouſly Examine, whether it be not abſolutely neceſſary either to be deceiv'd, or never to give our entire Conſent, except to things fully evident? Whether Truth does not always accompany Geometry, becauſe Geometricians obſerve this Rule? And if the Errors, into which ſome are fallen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Quadrature of the Circle, the Duplication of the Cube, and ſome other very difficult Problems, proceed not from ſome Precipitation, or Prejudice, which made 'em take an appearance of Truth for Truth it ſelf?</p>
                  <p>Let 'em conſider alſo on the other hand, if Falſeneſs and Confuſion does not reign in common Philoſophy, becauſe Philoſophers content themſelves with ſuch an eaſie Probability as is convenient for their Vanity and Intereſts. Do we not find every where an infinite Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Opinions, even upon the ſame Subjects, and conſequently an Infinity of Errors? Yet a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Diſciples ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduc'd, and blindly ſubmit to the Authority of theſe Philoſophers, without even comprehending their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions.</p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60613:26"/>
                  <p>'Tis true, there are ſome who perceive after twenty or thirty years Loſs of time, that they have learnt nothing in their Lectures, but they are aſham'd to make a ſincere Confeſſion of it. They firſt prove after their own way, that no certain Knowledge can be attained and afterwards they acknowledge, that they know nothing, becauſe they believe they may then ſafely do it without any Jeſt upon their Ignorance. It would be ſufficient matter of Diverſion and Laughter, to hear them give an account of their fine progreſs in Learning, and to get them in a humour of declaring all the Fatigues they have endur'd to acquire it; but altho this Learned and profound Ignorance deſerves our Raillery, it's much better to forbear it, and to pity thoſe who have thus ſpent ſo many years, only to Learn this falſe Propoſition, <hi>I know nothing,</hi> which is an Enemy to all Science and Truth.</p>
                  <p>Since the Rule then, which I have eſtabliſh'd, is ſo neceſſary in a <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> as we have ſeen it is, ſo that nothing can be objected againſt thoſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it; Let ſuch as will not take pains to obſerve it, at leaſt, not condemn ſo Illuſtrious an Author as Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> was, becauſe he followed, or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd, as near as he could, to follow it; They would not Conſure him ſo raſhly, if they knew him, nor would they read his Works, as Fables and Romances, which Men read for their Diverſion, not Inſtruction; if they throughly conſider'd this Author, they would ſtill find in themſelves ſome Notions, and Principles of Truth that he teaches, which would undeceive 'em in ſpight of the Prejudices of their Falſe Learning.</p>
                  <p>That Maſter which inwardly Dictates to us, would have us hear him rather than the Authority of the greateſt Philoſophers, He is pleaſed when He Inſtructs, provided we apply our ſelves to what He ſays; 'tis by Mieditation, and a very exact Attention, that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogate him; and 'tis by a certain inward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and the ſecret Reproaches of thoſe that do not conſent to it, by which He anſwers.</p>
                  <p>We ſhould ſo read the Works of Men, as not to hope to be inſtructed by Man, but interrogate Him
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60613:26"/>that is the Light of the World, ſo that we may be enlightn'd with the reſt of the World, if He does not enlighten us after we have Enquir'd of Him, no doubt we Enquir'd amiſs.</p>
                  <p>Whether therefore we read <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> we muſt not preſently believe either, but meditate as they did, or ought to have done, with all the attention whereof we are capable, and afterwards obey the Voice of our Common Maſter, and honeſtly ſubmit our ſelves to the inward Convictions and Motions which we feel in Meditation.</p>
                  <p>After this we are permitted to Judge for or againſt Authors; And thus having firſt digeſted the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes</hi>'s and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy, we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the one, and approve the other; and may be even aſſur'd, that the laſt ſhall never explain any Phoenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of Nature by his own Principles, which have been uſeleſs for theſe Two thouſand years, although his Philoſophy has been Studied by the Learned in almoſt all parts of the World, and that on the Contrary, we may boldly ſay of the other, that he hath pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated into that which appeared moſt obſcure in the Eyes of Men, and hath ſhew'd 'em a ſure way to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover all Truths that a limited Underſtanding can comprehend.</p>
                  <p>But without relying on the Opinion that we may have of theſe two Philoſophers, and of all others, let us ſtill look upon 'em as Men, and let not the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telians</hi> be diſpleaſed, if, after having walk'd ſo many Ages in Darkneſs, without being able to make any further Advancement, we are willing to ſee with our own Eyes, and if, after having been led like blind Men, we now remember that we have Eyes, and eſſay to Conduct our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Let us then be fully convinc'd of this Rule, <hi>Never to give an entire aſſent but to things that are evident.</hi> This is the moſt neceſſary of all Rules in a <hi>Search after Truth,</hi> and let us not admit any thing into our Minds as Truth, but what appears with the Evidence that this Rule demands. We muſt be perſuaded thereof, to lay by our Prejudices, and it's abſolutely neceſſary
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60613:27"/>that we be deliver'd from our Prepoſſeſſions to enter into the Knowledge of Truth, becauſe the Mind muſt be Purified before it can be Enlighten'd. <hi>Sapientia prima eſt Stulitia caruiſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But before we finiſh this Chapter,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Remarks upon what has been ſaid about the neceſſity of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
                     </note> we muſt Remark Three Things: The firſt is, that I ſpeak not here of Matters of Faith, which admit not the ſame Evidence as Natural Sciences do, becauſe we cannot perceive things, but by the Idea's which we have of them, for God hath only given us thoſe Idea's, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conduct us in the Natural Order of Things according to which we are created, ſo that the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of Faith being of a Supernatural Order, we muſt not be ſurpriz'd if we have not the ſame Idea's of them; for our Souls are created by Virtue of a General Decree, by which we have all the Notions that are neceſſary for us;
<note place="margin">See the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations.</note> But the Myſteries of Faith have been eſtabliſh'd only by the Order of Grace, which, according to our Ordinary way of Conception, is a Decree conſequent to that Order of Nature.</p>
                  <p>We ought then to diſtinguiſh the Myſteries of Faith from Natural Things. We muſt equally ſubmit to Faith and Evidence, but in Matters of Faith we muſt not look for ſuch Evidence as is in Natural Things; we muſt not rely upon the Faith, that is, upon the Authority of Philoſophers. In a word, to be Faithful, we muſt believe things not comprehended by Reaſon; but to be Philoſophers, we muſt take nothing upon Truſt.</p>
                  <p>'Tis univerſally agreed upon, that there are other Truths beſides thoſe of Faith, in which it would be unjuſt to demand inconteſtible Demonſtrations, ſuch, for Inſtance, as relate to Hiſtory, and other things depending upon Mans Will. For there are two ſorts of Truth, <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Contingent,</hi> I call them Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Truths, that are Immutable in their Nature, and have been Decreed by the unchangeable Will of God, all others are Contingent Truths; Mathematicks, Phyſicks, Metaphyſicks, and even a great part of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, contain Neceſſary Truths; Hiſtory, Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, particular Laws or Cuſtoms, and many other
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60613:27"/>things, which depend upon the uncertain Will of Man, include only Contingent Truths.</p>
                  <p>'Tis requir'd then, that the Rule, which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eſtabliſh'd, be exactly obſerved in a Search after Neceſſary Truths, whoſe Knowledge may be call'd Science; and we muſt content our ſelves with the greateſt probability of Truth in Hiſtory, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Knowledge of Contingent Things, for one may generally call by the name of Hiſtory the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Languages, Cuſtoms, and even that of the Different Opinions of Philoſophers, when they are only learn'd by Memory, without having had any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Certainty of them.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Thing to be Remark'd, is, that in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Politicks, Medicine, and in all Practical Sciences, we are oblig'd to content our ſelves with Probabilities, not always, but for a time, not becauſe it ſatisfies the Mind, but becauſe there is a neceſſity for it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if we ſhould defer acting, till we were fully aſſur'd of ſucceſs, we ſhould often looſe the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But though there's a neceſſity of our Acting, yet we ſhould doubtfully rely upon the event of theſe things we execute, and endeavour to make ſuch a progreſs in theſe Sciences, as that we may in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs act with more certainty; for this ought to be the ordinary end of the Study and Employ of all Thinking Men.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the third Obſervation is, that we muſt not abſolutely deſpiſe Probabilities, becauſe it ordinarily happens, that many of 'em being join'd together, can as ſtrongly convince us, as the moſt evident Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. Of this there are infinite Examples in Phyſick and Morality. So that oftentimes 'tis of uſe to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a ſufficient number of them, for Matters which can't be otherwiſe demonſtrated.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs here, that the Rule which I have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd is very rigorous; that many would rather deſire not to Reaſon at all, than to Reaſon upon theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that they will not move very faſt under ſuch Incommodious Circumſpections; yet they muſt agree with me, that they ſhould proceed ſurely in following
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60613:28"/>this Rule, and that hitherto, for having made too much haſte, they have been oblig'd to turn back again; and even a great many Men will agree with me, that ſince Monſteur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> hath diſcover'd more Truths in thirty years than all other Philoſophers, becauſe he ſubmitted to this Law: therefore, if many Men would Philoſophize as he did, they might in time know the greateſt part of thoſe things, which are neceſſary for as happy a Life, as can be had upon an Earth, which God hath Curſed.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have ſeen, that Men are only deceiv'd, becauſe they make not that uſe of their Liberty which they ought to do, and becauſe they do not moderate the haſte and eagerneſs of the Will for bare appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Truth; that Error conſiſts only in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Will, which is more capacious than the Perception of the Underſtanding; ſince Men would not be deceiv'd, if they only judg'd of what they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p>But though, properly ſpeaking, 'tis only an ill Uſe of Liberty which is the Cauſe of Error, yet it may be ſaid, that we have many Faculties, which are alſo the Cauſes thereof, not true Cauſes, but ſuch as may be call'd <hi>Occaſional</hi> ones.
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Occaſional Cauſes of theſe there are Five principal ones.</hi>
                     </note> All our Modes of Perceiving, are ſo many Occaſions of Deceiving us, for ſince our falſe Judgments include two things, the Conſent of the Will, and the Perception of the Underſtanding, it is very evident, that all our Modes of Perception may occaſionally deceive us, fince they are able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us to precipitate and raſh Aſſents.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:60613:28"/>
                  <p>Now, ſince 'tis neceſſary, firſt to convince the Soul of its Weakneſs and Errors, to create in it juſt deſires of being delivered from them, and that it may more eaſily lay aſide its Prejudices, we ſhall endeavour to make an exact Diviſion of all its Modes of Percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which will be as ſo many Heads, to every one of which we ſhall hereafter refer the different Errors we are ſubject to.</p>
                  <p>The Soul can perceive things three ways, by the pure <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> by the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and by the <hi>Senſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It perceives by the pure Underſtanding, Spiritual and Univerſal Things, common Notions, the Idea of Perfection, and of an Infinitely perfect Being, and generally all its Thoughts, when it knows them by Self-reflection. It alſo perceives ſome Material Things by the pure Underſtanding, as Extenſion with its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, for 'tis only the pure Underſtanding which can perceive a Circle, a perfect Square, a Figure with a thouſand Angles, and ſuch like things. Theſe kinds of Perceptions I call pure <hi>Intellections,</hi> or pure <hi>Perceptions,</hi> becauſe 'tis not neceſſary for the Mind to form Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Images in the Brain to repreſent all thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>The Soul perceives only Material Things by the <hi>Imagination,</hi> which repreſents them when abſent, as if they were preſent, by forming Images of them in the Brain. 'Tis thus that we imagine all ſorts of Figures, as a Circle, a Triangle, a Face, a Horſe, Cities, Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paignes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether we have ever ſeen them or not. Theſe ſorts of Perceptions I call <hi>Imaginations,</hi> becauſe the Soul repreſents theſe things by forming Images of them in the Brain; and becauſe we cannot form Images of Spiritual Things, it follows, that the Soul cannot imagine them, which ought to be well obſerved.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the Soul only perceives ſenſible and groſs Objects by the <hi>Senſes,</hi> which, when preſent, make an Impreſſion upon the External Organs of its Body; Thus it ſees Plains and Rocks, when preſented to its Eyes, and feels the hardneſs of Iron, the point of a Sword, and ſuch like things, and theſe ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions I call <hi>Sentiments</hi> or <hi>Senſations.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The Soul then only perceives things after theſe three ways, which is evident, if we conſider that all things we perceive are either Spiritual or Material; if they are Spiritual, 'tis only the <hi>pure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> which can know them; but if they are Material, they will be either preſent or abſent; if they are abſent, the Soul perceives them only by the Imagination; if preſent, by the Impreſſion which they make upon its Senſes; and thus, as we ſaid before, our Souls only perceive things after three ways, by the <hi>pure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> by the <hi>Imagination,</hi> and by the <hi>Senſes.</hi>

                  <p>We may then look upon theſe three Faculties, as certain Heads, to which we may refer Mens Errors, and the Cauſes of theſe Errors, and ſo avoid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion wherein their great number would infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve us, if we ſhould ſpeak of 'em without any Method.</p>
                  <p>But our Inclinations and Paſſions act alſo very ſtrongly upon us, they dazle our Minds by their falſe lights, they cover and fill it with darkneſs; Thus our Inclinations and Paſſions engage us in an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Errors, when we follow this falſe light which they produce in us.

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen we ſeriouſly Examine the Senſes and Paſſions of Man, we find 'em ſo proportion'd to the end for which they are given us, that we are not of their Opinion, who ſay, they are wholly corrupted by Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin; But to ſhew that 'tis not without Reaſon that we diſſent from them, 'tis neceſſary to explain in what Order the Faculties and Paſſions of our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent were, whilſt in a State of Righteouſneſs, and the Changes and Diſorders which happen'd in them after his Sin; Theſe things may be conceiv'd two ways, the firſt of which is this:</p>
                  <p>It appears,
<note place="margin">Two ways of Explaining the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Senſes by Sin.</note> if we conſider the Genuine Order of things, that the Soul is ſenſible of greater pleaſure, proportionably to the greatneſs of the <hi>Goods</hi> which it enjoys. Pleaſure is an Inſtinct of Nature, or to ſpeak more intelligibly, 'tis an Impreſſion of God himſelf inclining us towards ſome Good, which muſt be ſo much the ſtronger, as the Good is greater. According to this Principle, I think we cannot doubt, but that our firſt Parent coming out of the Hands of God, and before his Sin, found the greateſt pleaſure in the moſt ſolid <hi>Goods.</hi> Since therefore he was Created to Love God, and ſince God was his true Good, it may
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60613:30"/>ſaid, that he was inclined to delight in God, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd him to his Love by a Senſation of Pleaſure, and gave him ſuch Internal Satisfactions in his Duty, as counterbalanc'd the greateſt Pleaſures of Senſe, and ſuch as, ſince the Fall, Men are inſenſible of, without a particular Grace.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, as he had a Body, which God would have him preſerve, and look upon, as part of himſelf, he alſo made him perceive ſuch Pleaſures by his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as we taſte in the uſe of things, that are proper for the Preſervation of Life.</p>
                  <p>We dare not decide, whether the firſt Man, before his Fall, could avoid agreeable, or diſagreeable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, in the very moment that the Principal part of his Brain was mov'd by the Actual uſe of Senſible Things; perhaps, he had this Command over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, becauſe of his Submiſſion to God, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary appears more probable, for tho' <hi>Adam</hi> could ſtay the Emotions of the Spirits and Blood, and the Shaking of the Brain, which Objects excited in him, becauſe not being yet diſordered, his Body was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily ſubject to his Mind: Yet 'tis not likely that he could forbear having Senſations of Objects, at ſuch time as he had not ſtopt the Motions which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd in ſome part of his Body, to which his Soul was immediately United; for the Union of the Soul and Body, conſiſting chiefly in a Mutual Relation between the Senſations of the Soul, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Organs of the Body, it appears that it would have been rather Arbitrary than Natural, if <hi>Adam</hi> could have been Inſenſible, when the chief part of his Body receiv'd ſome Impreſſion from External Objects; but I forbear making my ſelf a Party in theſe two Opinions.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Man then took Pleaſure in that which added Perfection to his Body, even as in that which did ſo to his Soul; and becauſe he was in a perfect State, he found the Pleaſure of the Soul much greater than that of the Body; ſo that it was much eaſier for him to preſerve his Righteouſneſs, without the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, than it is for us, fince without it we
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60613:30"/>feel but little ſatisfaction in our Duty;
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S.</hi> Greg. <hi>Hom.</hi> 39. <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Goſpels.</hi>
                     </note> yet he ſuffer'd himſelf unhappily to be Seduc'd, and loſt his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs by his Diſobedience; and the principal Change which happen'd to him, and which caus'd all the Diſorder of his Senſes and Paſſions, is, That God forſook him by way of Puniſhment, and would no longer be his Good, or, rather, would not any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger make him ſenſible of that Pleaſure which aſſur'd him that he was his Good: So that Senſible Pleaſures, which do but incline a Man to Corporeal Good, remaining only, and being no longer Counterballanc'd by theſe, which formerly carry'd him to his true Good, the ſtrict Union which he had with God is ſtrangely weaken'd, and that which he had with his Body is much ſtrengthned; Senſible Pleaſure reigns in his Corrupted Heart, by enſlaving him to all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects, and the Corruption of his Heart hath darkned his Mind, by turning it aſide from that Light which Enlightens it, and inclining it to Judge only of Things, as they can have any Relation with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>But after all, we cannot ſay that there was any great Change in reſpect of the Senſes, 'tis as if two Weights hang'd in Aequilibrio in a Ballance, and I ſhould take ſomething from one of them, the other would weigh down, without any Change in its ſelf, in Relation to the firſt Weight, ſince it is ſtill the ſame. Thus after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Pleaſures of the Senſes have Senſualiz'd the Soul, for want of thoſe Internal Delights, which before Counterballanc'd the Inclination we have for Senſible Goods, but without ſuch a conſiderable Change in the Senſes as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly imagin'd.</p>
                  <p>But to come to the ſecond way of Explaining the Diſorders of Sin, and which is certainly more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than the preceeding: 'Tis very different from the former, becauſe it depends upon a different Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, however they both agree in what reſpects the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe we are Compos'd of Mind and Body, we have two ſorts of <hi>Goods</hi> to enquire after, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60613:31"/>of the Mind, and thoſe of the Body. We have alſo two ways of knowing whether a thing is good or bad for us, by the Help of the Mind only, or by the Aſſiſtance of the Mind and Body together; We can know what is Good for us, by a clear and evident Knowledge, as alſo by a Confus'd Senſation. I know, by Reaſon, that Juſtice is Amiable; I alſo know, by Taſte, that ſuch Fruit is Good: The Beauty of Juſtice is not Taſted, the Goodneſs of Fruit is not known by Reaſon, the Goods of the Body deſerve not the application of a Mind, which God has made only for himſelf; the Mind then muſt receive ſuch kind of Goods, by a ſhort and Inconteſtable Proof of Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without examining any further: Stones are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for Nouriſhment, Experience proves it, and Taſte alone will convince all Men of it.</p>
                  <p>Pleaſure and Pain are therefore Natural and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Characters of Good and Evil, I confeſs it, but 'tis for ſuch things only, as in their own Nature are neither good nor bad, nor can be known for ſuch, by a clear and diſtinct Knowledge; and 'tis only for ſuch things, that, being below the Mind of Man, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reward nor Puniſh it: In fine, 'tis for ſuch things only, as are unworthy the Application of the Mind; and about which, God being unwilling our Mind ſhould be imploy'd, inclines us to them only by a certain Inſtinct; I mean, by agreeable or diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Senſations.</p>
                  <p>But as for God, who is only the true Good of the Mind, and who only is above it, who only can Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it a thouſand different ways, who is only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy its Application, and who is not afraid, that thoſe that Love him, ſhould not find him Amiable; He is not content to be lov'd with a Blind Love, or a Love of Inſtinct, but will be lov'd with a Rational Love, and a Love of Choice.</p>
                  <p>If the Mind ſaw only thoſe things in Objects, that are truly there, with adding other things to them by the Imagination, which really are not, it would find much difficulty to Love, or make Uſe of them; ſo that it is, as it were, neceſſary for them to appear
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60613:31"/>agreeable, by cauſing Senſations which they have not, but 'tis not ſo with God, it's ſufficient to ſee him as he is, to incline us to him, and it is not neceſſary that he make uſe of this Inſtinct of Pleaſure, as a kind of Artifice, to draw our Love to him, without his deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it.</p>
                  <p>Hence we muſt conclude, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Love of God, and his Duty, by
<note n="*" place="margin">Soe the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed Pleaſure, becauſe the Knowledge which he had of God, as his Good, and the Joy that he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually felt,
<note place="margin">Deus ab ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it hominem &amp; reliquit illum in manu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilii ſui adje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepta ſua Ecc. 15.15.</note> as a neceſſary conſequent of ſeeing his Happineſs, in being United to God, might ſuffice to keep him to his Duty, and make him act more De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervingly, than if he had been, as it were, Determin'd by a prepoſſeſs'd Pleaſure. After this manner he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd full Liberty; and, perhaps, 'twas in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that the Holy Scripture would Repreſent him by theſe Words, <hi>God made Man in the beginning, and after having propos'd his Commandments to him, he left him to himſelf;</hi> that is, without determining him by the Senſe of ſome Prepoſſeſs'd Pleaſure, only keeping him cloſe to a clear Light of his Happineſs and Duty. But Experience hath ſhown the frailty of <hi>Adam,</hi> in ſo Regulated and Happy Eſtate, as that he was in before his Fall, to the Shame of Free Will, and the Glory of God alone.</p>
                  <p>But it cannot be ſaid that <hi>Adam</hi> was inclin'd to ſeek after, and make uſe of Senſible Things, by an exact Knowledge of the Relation they might have with his Body, for if he had, he muſt have Examin'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations of the parts of ſome Fruit, with all the parts of his own Body, and the Relation reſulting from both, to be able to Judge, whether in the heat of his Blood, and a thouſand other Diſpoſitions of his Body, this Fruit would be proper for his Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; 'tis plain, that his Mind was intirely imploy'd upon things that were unworthy its application, and even unproſitably enough, becauſe he was not long preſerv'd after this manner.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider then, that the Mind of <hi>Adam</hi> was not Infinite, we may ſafely ſay, that he knew not all
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60613:32"/>the Properties of Bodies that were about him, ſince 'tis manifeſt that they are Infinite; and if it be granted, which cannot reaſonably be deny'd, that his Mind was not made to Examine the Motions and Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Matter, but for the Contemplation of God, no one can be diſpleas'd, if we aſſert, that it was biaſs'd and diſorder'd in that time, wherein all things ſhould have been perfectly well order'd, if he had been oblig'd to turn his Mind from the Conſideration of the Perfection of his true Good, to Examine the Nature of ſome Fruit for his Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> then had the ſame Senſations as we have, which ſuggeſted to him what was neceſſary for his Body, without being diverted from God; he was Senſible of Pleaſures as we are, and even of Pains, or prepoſſeſs'd and indeliberate Averſions, but theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Pains could not Enſlave him, or render him Unhappy like us, becauſe that being Abſolute Maſter of all the Motions which were excited in his Body, he immediately put a ſtop to them, if he only wiſh'd they might ceaſe, and certainly he always wiſh'd it, in reſpect of Pain. How happy had he been, and we alſo, if he had done the ſame in reſpect of Pleaſure, and if he had not voluntary ſtrayed from the preſence of his God, by ſuffering his Mind to be taken up with the Beauty, and expected Sweetneſs of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit, or, perhaps, with a Preſumptuous Joy that was excited in his Soul, at the Conſideration of his Natural Perfections.</p>
                  <p>But after he had Sin'd, thoſe Pleaſures which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only modeſtly Accoſted him, and thoſe Pains, which without diſturbing his Felicity, only put him in mind that he might Fall, and become Miſerable, were not any longer under his Command, his Senſes and Paſſions Revolted againſt him, they became Irregular, and made him, like us, a Slave to all Senſible Things.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Senſes and Paſſions, do not derive their Origination from Sin, but only the Power they have of Tyrannizing over Sinners; and this Power has not ſo much diſorder'd the Senſes, as the Mind and Will of Men, which ceaſing to be ſo ſtrictly united to God.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60613:32"/>do not any longer receive that Light and Vigour, by which they might preſerve their Liberty and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>From theſe two ways of Explaining the Diſorders of Sin, we may eaſily gather,
<note place="margin">A Remedy for that Diſorder which Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin hath cauſed in the World; and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christian Morality.</note> that there are two things neceſſary for our Recovery.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, That we muſt leſſen that Load we ſink under, and which drags towards Senſible. Goods, by continually Retrenching our Pleaſures, and Mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Senſuality with Repentance and Circumciſion of Heart.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, That we muſt beg the Aſſiſtance of God's Grace, and that prepoſſeſs'd Delight which
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations.</note> Jeſus Chriſt hath particularly Merited for us; without which, whatever we retrench from that firſt load, will ſtill oppreſs us, and however ſmall it is, it will Infallibly draw into Sin and Diſorder.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two things are abſolutely Neceſſary for us, to begin and perſevere in our Duty; Reaſon, as we have ſhow'd, does perfectly agree with the Goſpel in this, and from both we learn, that Humility, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, and the Diminution of the Power of Sin, are neceſſary Preparations for our Recovery, by the Power of Grace, and Re-union with God.</p>
                  <p>But in our preſent State, tho' we are continually oblig'd to ſtrive againſt our Senſes, yet we muſt not thence conclude, that they are abſolutely corrupted and deprav'd; for if we conſider that they are given us for the Preſervation of our Bodies, we ſhall find that they admirably well perform their Duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct us, after ſo juſt and faithful a manner, for the end we receiv'd them, that it ſeems very injurious ſo to accuſe them of Corruption and Diſorder; they ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily inform the Soul by Pain and Pleaſure, by agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and diſagreeable Senſations, of what is neceſſary to be done or omitted, for the Preſervation of Life, that we have little reaſon to ſay, this order and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is the Conſequence of Sin.

                  <p>Our Senſes then are not ſo deprav'd as is imagin'd, but the inward Conſtitution of our Soul; 'tis our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty that is Corrupted; 'tis not our Senſes, but our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60613:33"/>Will that deceives us, by its precipitate Judgments.

                  <p>The Senſes then do not deceive us, if we make a good uſe of our Liberty, and if we accuſtom not our ſelves, upon their account, to Judge of things with too much precipitation; but ſince it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to refrain from it, and we are, as it were, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd thereto, becauſe of the ſtrict Union between our Soul and Body, I ſhall lay down a Method to conduct us in our uſe of them, ſo as to avoid Error.</p>

Then they have Legs, and Feet, and Bones in theſe Legs to uphold them, Muſcles to move them, Tendons, and an infinite Number of Fibres in each Muſcle; and laſtly, Blood, or Animal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60613:34"/>Spirits, extreamly ſubtile and fine, to fill and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute ſucceſſive Motion to theſe Muſcles. It's impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without this, to conceive that they Live, are Nouriſh'd, and Tranſport their little Bodies into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Places, according to the different Impreſſion of Objects; or, rather, 'tis impoſſible that even thoſe, who have employ'd all their Life time in Anatomy, and an Enquiry into Nature, ſhould repreſent the number, diverſity, and fineneſs of all the parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of theſe little Bodies are neceſſarily Compos'd, to make them live, and execute all thoſe things, that we ſee them do.</p>
                  <p>The Imagination is loſt and aſtoniſh'd, at the ſight of ſo ſurprizing a Smallneſs; it cannot apprehend, nor take hold of ſuch Parts that have no hold for it; and altho' Reaſon convinces us of the Truth of what we have ſaid, yet the Senſes and Imagination oppoſe it, and often compel us to doubt of it.</p>
                  <p>Our Sight is extreamly limited, but we muſt not limit its Object, the Idea which it gives us of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion hath very narrow Bounds, but we muſt not thence conclude, that Extenſion hath the ſame Bounds; it is, doubtleſs, Infinite in one Senſe, and this little part of Matter, that is hid from Eyes, is capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a World, in which there are as many things, tho' much leſs in Proportion, as in this great World we Inhabit.</p>
                  <p>The little Animals we ſpoke of, have, perhaps, other little Animals, which they devour, that are Imperceptible, becauſe of their Stupendious Smallneſs. That which is a Handworm, in reſpect of us, theſe Animals are ſo in reſpect of it; and, perhaps, there are in Nature yet leſſer and leſſer, <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> in ſo ſtrange a Proportion as this, betwixt a Man and a Handworm.</p>
                  <p>We have Evident, and Mathematical Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the infinite Diviſibility of Matter, and this is ſufficient to incline us to believe, that there may be Animals leſſer and leſſer, <hi>ad Infinitum,</hi> altho' out Imagination is loſt in the Thought. God made Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only to form Admirable Works thereof, and ſince we are certain there are no Particles, whoſe Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60613:34"/>is capable of limiting his Power in the formation of thoſe little Animals, why do we unreaſonably li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and diminiſh the Idea we have of an Infinite Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, by meaſuring his Power and Operations by our Finite Underſtanding?</p>
                  <p>Experience has already undeceived us in part, by ſhewing us Animals a thouſand times leſs than a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm, why would we have them to be the laſt and leaſt of all? for my part I ſee no reaſon to imagine it, on the contrary, it's much more probable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there are ſome yet much leſſer than thoſe we have diſcovered; for indeed thoſe little Animals are not ſo much wanting for Microſcopes, as Microſcopes for them.</p>
                  <p>When we examine the

                     <hi>Germ</hi>(in the midſt of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) taken out of the Bole of Tulip, either by the Naked Eye, or a Convex Glaſs we very eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover leaves in it that will become green, thoſe that are to compoſe the Flower of the Tulip, that little Triangular part which encloſes the Seed, and the ſix little Columns which encompaſs it at the bottom of the Tulip; ſo that we cannot doubt but the <hi>Germ</hi> in the Bole of the Tulip contains a whole Tulip.</p>
                  <p>It is reaſonable to believe the ſame of the <hi>Germ</hi> of a Grain of Muſtard, that of the Kernel of an Apple, and generally of all ſorts of Trees and Plants, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though undiſcoverable by the Naked Eye, nor even with a Microſcope; and it may be confidently ſaid, that all Trees are contain'd <hi>in little</hi> in the <hi>Germ</hi> of their Seed.</p>
                  <p>It does not appear unreaſonable to think that there are an infinite number of Trees in one ſingle <hi>Germ,</hi> ſince it does not only contain the Tree whoſe Seed it is, but alſo a great number of other Seeds, which may alſo include in themſelves new Trees, and new Seeds of Trees, which laſt alſo may contain other Trees and Seeds as fruitful as the firſt, and thus on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> So that according to this Opinion, which cannot appear impertinent or ridiculous to any, but thoſe who meaſure the Wonders of the Almighty Power of God after the Idea's of their own Senſes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60613:35"/>and Imaginations, one might ſay, that in one Kernel only of an Apple there might be Apple-Trees, Apples, and Seeds of Apple-Trees for almoſt infinite Ages, in the proportion of a perfect Apple-Tree to an Apple-Tree in its Seed; and that Nature does only unfold theſe little Trees by adminiſtring a ſenſible growth to that which is out of its Seed, and an inſenſible, but real growth, proportionable to their bigneſs, to thoſe which we may conceive to be their Seeds; for we cannot doubt but that there may be Bodies ſmall enough to inſinuate themſelves in the Fibres of theſe Trees, which we may conceive to be their Seeds, and by that means to nouriſh them.</p>
                  <p>What we have ſaid of Plants and their <hi>Germs,</hi> may be alſo applied to Animals, and the <hi>Germ</hi> of which they are produc'd; We ſee in the <hi>Germ</hi> of a Tulip's Bole, an entire Tulip;

                  <p>We might carry this Thought yet farther, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly with much Reaſon and Truth, but we think it not ſafe to ſearch too deep into the Works of God, which are altogether infinite; not only our Senſes and Imagination are limited in their Comprehenſion, but alſo the pure Mind wholly diſengag'd from Matter, is too groſs and feeble to penetrate into the leaſt of his Works, 'tis loſt and diſſipated, dazled and affrighted at the ſight of what we call an Atome, according to the Language of the Senſes; but the pure Mind has always this advantage above the Imagination and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60613:35"/>Senſes, that it knows its own weakneſs, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God; that it perceives the infinity in which it is loſt, whereas our Imagination and Senſes debaſe the Works of God, and raiſe in us a fooliſh Conſidence, which blindly precipitates us into Error. Our Eyes beget in us no Idea of all theſe things that we diſcover by Microſcopes or by Reaſon; we ſee no leſs a Body with our Eyes than a Worm in the Skin or a Mite, the half of which is nothing, if compar'd with our ſelves: A Mite is but as a Mathematick Point in reſpect of us, it cannot be divided, but it muſt be anni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; Our Sight then does not repreſent Extenſion to us, as it is in it ſelf, but according to what it is in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our Body, and becauſe the half of a Mite bears no proportion to our Body, and can neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit nor injure it, therefore we can't ſee it.</p>
                  <p>But if our Eyes were made as Microſcopes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if they were as ſmall as thoſe of Hand-worms or Mites, we ſhould judge otherwiſe of the magnitude of Bodies, for without doubt theſe little Animals have Eyes qualified to ſee all that is about them, as alſo their own Body in a much larger proportion than we ſee it, if not they would not receive thoſe impreſſions that are neceſſary for the preſervation of themſelves, and then their Eyes would be wholly uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>To explain theſe things thoroughly, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that our own Eyes are indeed nothing elſe but Natural Spectacles, that their Humours produce the ſame Effect, as the Glaſſes in Spectacles, and that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Figure of the Chryſtaline Humour, and its diſtance from the Retina, we ſee Objects very differently; inſomuch, that we are certain there are not two Men in the World, who ſee things in the ſame bigneſs, unleſs their Eyes were in all reſpects alike.</p>
                  <p>This is a Propoſition that muſt be received by all thoſe that ſtudy Opticks, <hi>viz.</hi> That Equidiſtant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects appear ſo much the greater, by how much the Image of them is painted greater in the inward part of the Eye. Now 'tis certain, that thoſe Eyes whoſe Cryſtaline Humour is more Convex, have leſſer Images depai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ted in 'em, in proportion to their Convexity;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60613:36"/>Thoſe then who are the neareſt ſighted, having the Chryſtaline Humour more Convex, ſee Objects in a leſſer proportion than old Men who have occaſion for Spectacles in Reading, or thoſe who have common Convexity, and ſee very well at a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things are eaſily demonſtrated Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and if they were not commonly known, we ſhould inſiſt the longer upon them; but becauſe many have treated upon theſe Matters, thoſe that would be better inform'd are deſir'd to conſult Authors upon it.</p>
                  <p>Since 'tis certain that there are not two Men in the World who ſee Objects in the ſame bigneſs, and that commonly the
<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>See the Journal des Scavans du Mois de Janvier,</hi> 1969.</note> ſame Perſon ſees the ſame things greater with one Eye than another; 'tis plain that we are not to truſt to the proportion of things which our Eyes repreſent to us, we muſt rather conſult our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which proves, that we cannot determine the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute bigneſs of Bodies that are about us, nor what Idea we ought to have of the Extenſion of a Foot Square, or of that of our own Body, ſo as that this Idea ſhould truly repreſent it to us; for Reaſon tells us, that the leaſt of all Bodies, conſider'd in it ſelf, would not be little, ſince it is compos'd of an infinite number of parts, out of every one of which God could form a World, which would be but as a Point in reſpect of all the reſt joined together. Thus the Mind of Man is incapable of forming an Idea great enough to comprehend the leaſt Extenſion in the World ſince it is limited, but the Idea of Matter is infinite. It is true, the Mind can very near apprehend the proportions, that are betwixt theſe Infinites whereof the World is Compos'd, that one, for Inſtance, is the double of another, that a
<note n="*" place="margin">A French Meaſure.</note> Toiſe contains 6 Feet, yet we cannot form an Idea that repreſents what theſe things are in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>We'll ſuppoſe, that the Mind is ſuſceptible of thoſe Idea's, which are equal to, or which meaſure the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of Bodies that we ſee, for it would be very difficult to perſwade Men to the contrary; Let us examine then what may be concluded from this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; This doubtleſs, that God does not deceive
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60613:36"/>us, that he has not given us Eyes like Convex Glaſſes to enlarge or diminiſh Objects, therefore we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that our Eyes repreſents things as they are.</p>
                  <p>It is true God never deceives us, but we often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves in judging of things with too much precipitation; for we often judge that Objects, whereof we have Idea's, do exiſt, and that they perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble our Idea's; yet it frequently happens, that the Objects are either unlike our Idea's, or elſe have no Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence at all: ſo that if we have an Idea of any thing, it does not follow from thence, that ſuch a thing exiſts, much leſs, that it ſhould wholly reſemble the Idea we have of it; for altho' God produces in us ſuch a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Idea of Magnitude, when a <hi>Toiſe</hi> is before our Eyes, it follows not from thence, that this <hi>Toiſe</hi> hath only the Extenſion, which by this Idea is repreſented to us. For, firſt, all Men have not the Senſible Idea of this <hi>Toiſe,</hi> ſince all have not their Eyes diſpos'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner. Secondly, even the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon has not the ſame Senſible Idea thereof, when it is ſeen with one Eye, and then with the other, as we Inſtanc'd before. Laſtly, it often happens that the ſame Perſon, hath very different Idea's of the ſame Objects at different times, according as he believes them to be nearer, or farther off him; which ſhall be elſewhere Explain'd. 'Tis then an unreaſonable Prejudice, to believe that we ſee Bodies according in their juſt bigneſs, for our Eyes being only given us for the Preſervation of our Body, they very well diſcharge their Office, when they cauſe thoſe Idea's of Objects in us, that are proportionate to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. But that we may the better comprehend how we ought to Judge of the Extenſion of Bodies, in Relation to the Teſtimony of our Eyes, let us imagine, that God had created a Heaven, and an Earth, of a Portion of Matter as little as a Hand Ball; and Men, upon this Earth, in the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions with thoſe in our Great World: Theſe little Men would ſee one another, and the parts of their own Bodies, as alſo the little Animals, which would be capable of incommoding them, or elſe their Eyes
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60613:37"/>would be uſeleſs as to their Preſervation. Upon this Suppoſition it is Evident, that theſe little Men would have Idea's, as to the bigneſs of Bodies, very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe that we have of them, ſince they would have Relation to their Little World, which, tho' as a Ball, in reſpect of ours, they would look upon as ſurrounded with infinite Spaces, ſuch as we imagine about ours.</p>
                  <p>Or, if it may more eaſily be conceiv'd, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that God had made a World infinitely greater than ours, ſo that this New World ſhould be, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of ours, as ours was in compariſon of that which we ſuppos'd before. Let us alſo ſuppoſe, that God had obſerv'd the ſame Proportion, in all the Parts of this New World, as he had done in ours; It's mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the Men of this laſt World would be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than is the Space betwixt our Earth, and the moſt diſtant Stars that we ſee; this being ſuppos'd, if they had the ſame Idea of the Extenſion of Bodies as we have, they could not diſtinguiſh even ſome parts of their own Body, and would ſee ſome others of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious greatneſs: So that 'tis ridiculous to think, that they would ſee things of the ſame bigneſs as we ſee them.</p>
                  <p>'Tis evident, from theſe two Suppoſitions, that the Men of the Great, or Little World, would have very different Notions, about the greatneſs of Bodies, to what we have, ſuppoſing only, that their Eyes gave them Idea's of the Objects, that were about them, proportionably in bigneſs to their own Bodies; Now if theſe Men were much aſſur'd, upon the Teſtimony of their own Eyes, that Bodies were as big as they ſaw them, it's evident they would be deceiv'd, and no body can doubt of it; yet, it's certain, they would have full as much reaſon as we, to defend their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, let us therefore, at leaſt, by the Example of this Error, apprehend our ſelves to be very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the greatneſs of thoſe Bodies that we ſee, and that all we can know by ſight, is the proportion that they have to our Bodies. In a word, that our Eyes are not given us to Judge of the Truth of things, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60613:37"/>only to diſcern thoſe things that may either Profit, or Injure us.</p>
                  <p>But Men do not only truſt their Eyes in Judging of Viſible, but alſo of Inviſible Objects; they even conclude, that nothing exiſts which they ſee not, thus arrogating to their Sight a certain infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicacity. 'Tis this which hinders them from knowing the true Cauſes of many Natural Effects: If they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute them to certain Faculties, and imaginary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the common Reaſon is, becauſe they do not ſee the real ones, which conſiſt in the different Configu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of theſe Bodies.</p>
                  <p>For Example, They ſee not the Particles of Air and Flame, much leſs thoſe of Light, or of other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter yet more Subtile; and this inclines them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they do not exiſt, or at leaſt, to judge they have neither Power nor Action; they have recourſe to occult Qualities, or imaginary Faculties, to explain all the effects whereof theſe imperceptible Particles are the Natural Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>They chooſe rather to have recourſe to the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of a <hi>Vacuum,</hi> for explaining the Elevation of the Water in Pumps, than to the Weight of the Air; to the Qualities of the Moon, for the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, than to the preſſure of the Air which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons the Earth; to attractive Faculties in the Sun, for the Elevation of Vapours, than to the Simple Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Impulſion, caus'd by the parts of Subtile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which are continually diſpers'd by the Sun.</p>
                  <p>They look upon that as an Impertinent Opinion, which has recourſe to Fleſh and Blood, to ſolve the Motions of Animals, their Habits, or the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Memory of Man, which is owning, in part, to this, that they conceive the Brain to be very little, and conſequently, inſufficient to conſerve the traces of an almoſt infinite number of things, which are there; they are willing to believe, tho' they know not how to conceive it, that Beaſts have a certain Soul which is neither Body nor Mind; as alſo, that there are Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Intentional Species, to ſolve the Habits and Memory of Men, and ſuch other like things, of which they have no particular Notion in their Minds.</p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:60613:38"/>
                  <p>It would take up too much time to enumerate the Errors which this prejudice begets in us, almoſt all the Errors in Phyſicks are owing to it, and whoever attentively conſiders it, will be amaz'd thereat.</p>
                  <p>Altho' I'm unwilling to inſiſt much upon this head, yet I can't but take notice of the Contempt which Men commonly have for Inſects, and other little Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, which are generated, as they ſay, out of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Matter; this is an unjuſt Contempt, which is founded only upon the Ignorance of the thing deſpis'd, and the prejudices already mention'd. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Contemptible in Nature, all the Works of God are worthy our reſpect and admiration, eſpecially if we conſider the admirable ways by which God makes and preſerves them. The leaſt Flies are as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Animals as the biggeſt Creatures, the proportion of their Members is as Juſt as thoſe of the others, and it even ſeems, that God has given them more Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to recompence the littleneſs of their Bodies; they have Crowns, Helmets, and other Curioſities, on their Heads, which outdo the moſt Luxuriant Fancies of Men; and I may confidently aver, that they who have never ſeen any thing but with their naked Eye, have never beheld any thing ſo fine, ſo exact, and even ſo magnificent, in the Houſes of the greateſt Princes, as what we diſcover with Microſcopes upon the Head of a ſilly Fly.</p>
                  <p>It's true, theſe things are very ſmall, but yet the more ſurprizing, becauſe there are ſo many Beauties crouded in ſo ſmall a Space, and altho' they are very common, yet they are not the leſs valuable, nor leſs perfect in themſelves; on the contrary, the Wiſdom of God is more apparent, who hath with ſo much Magnificence and Profuſion, perform'd almoſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Miracles in Creating them.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, our Sight reaches not theſe Beauties, but makes us deſpiſe the Works of God, ſo worthy our admiration; and becauſe theſe Animals are little, in compariſon of our Bodies, it makes us conſider them as abſolutely little and contemptible, becauſe of their ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>llneſs, as if Bodies could be little in themſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60613:38"/>
                  <p>Let us then endeavour to diſtruſt the Impreſſions of our Senſes, in Judging about the bigneſs of Bodies; and when we ſay, for Example, that a Bird is little, let us not abſolutely underſtand it to be ſo, becauſe nothing is either great or little in it ſelf. Even a Bird is great, in compariſon of a Fly, but little in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of our Bodies, but it does not follow that it is ſo abſolutely, for our Body is not the Standard Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of other Bodies, it's but very ſmall in relation to the Earth, and that in relation to the Circle, which the Sun or the Earth deſcribes, one about the other, and this Circle, in compariſon of the Space betwixt us and the fixt Stars; and thus we may ſtill imagine Spaces larger and larger, <hi>ad Infinitum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But we muſt not think that our Senſes give us the juſt proportion that Bodies have to one another,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Of the Error of our Eyes, about Extenſion of Bodies, in relation to one another.</hi>
                     </note> for exactneſs is not eſſential to Senſible Knowledge, which is only uſeful for the Preſervation of Life: It's true, we know preciſely enough the proportion that Bodies have one with another, if they be near us, but we know little of the proportion that diſtant Bodies have, becauſe they have little relation to our Body. The Idea of bigneſs which we have at the ſight of ſome Body, diminiſhes in proportion, to the condition that this Body is in of hurting us, and this Idea is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently enlarg'd as Bodies approach us, or rather, as the relation they have with our Body, encreaſes. Laſtly, this Relation wholly ceaſes, I mean, if any Body is ſo little, or diſtant from us, that it cannot hurt us, we have no more any Senſation of it. So that by the Eye, we may ſometimes judge very near of the proportion that ſome Bodies have with ours, as alſo, of that they have among themſelves, but we muſt never believe them to be of that bigneſs which they appear to us.</p>
                  <p>Our Eyes, for Example, repreſent the Sun and Moon about the bigneſs of one or two Feet over, but we muſt not imagine, as <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius</hi> did, that they are really of this bigneſs; the Moon appears much greater to the Sight than the fix'd Stars, tho' it's certain, that in compariſon of them, it is very ſmall.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60613:39"/>Thus, likewiſe, we ſee every day, upon the Earth, two or more things, whoſe bigneſs we cannot truly diſcover, becauſe it's neceſſary to have their true diſtance before we Judge of them, which is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to know.</p>
                  <p>We have the ſame trouble to make a certain Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Proportion of two Bodies, which are cloſe to us, they muſt be taken in our hands, and compar'd together; and after all, we frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main doubtful about them. This is evident, when we would examine two pieces of Money, which are almoſt equal, for then we are oblig'd to place them one upon another, to try, by a ſurer way than the bare ſight, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ther they are equal or not. Hence we conclude, that our ſight does not only deceive us, in reſpect of the bigneſs of Bodies, as they are in themſelves, but alſo in the Proportion which they have when compar'd together.</p>

                  <p>OUR Sight deceives us leſs in the Repreſentation of Figures,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of Sight concerning Figures.</hi>
                     </note> than of all other things, becauſe a Figure, conſider'd in it ſelf, is abſolutely nothing, and becauſe its Nature conſiſts only in the Relation that is betwixt the Parts which terminate ſome Space, and a Point which is conceiv'd in this Space, and which may be call'd, as in a Circle, the Centre of the Figure; yet we are deceiv'd a thouſand ways in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60613:39"/>Figures, and we have never any exact Knowledge of them by the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall now prove,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That we have no Knowledge of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things.</hi>
                     </note> that our Sight reaches not all ſort of Extenſion, but that only which hath a very conſiderable Relation with our Body; and for this reaſon, we ſee not all the parts of the leaſt Animals, or thoſe that compoſe hard or liquid Bodies. So that being unable to perceive all theſe Parts, becauſe of their ſmallneſs, it follows, that we cannot perceive their Figures, ſince the Figure of a Body is only the Term that limits it. There are then an infinite number of Figures, and even of the greateſt, which our Eyes diſcover not to us, and therefore they incline the Mind, which relies too much upon their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, and which does not ſufficiently examine things, to believe that theſe Figures do not Exiſt.</p>
                  <p>As for Bodies, that are accommodated to our Sight,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>That the Knowledge we have of the greateſt is not exact.</hi>
                     </note> which are very few in number in compariſon of others, we diſcover their Figure very near, but we never know it exactly by the Senſes, we can't even be aſſur'd, by the Sight, whether a Circle or a Square, which are two of the moſt Simple Figures, are not an Ellipſe or a Parallelogram, altho' we had theſe Figures in our Hands, and as near our Eyes as we pleas'd.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, we can't exactly diſtinguiſh whether a Line is right or not; eſpecially, if it be pretty long, we muſt have a Rule for that. But why? We know not whether the Rule it ſelf is ſuch as we ſuppoſe it ſhould be, and we cannot abſolutely aſſure our ſelves thereof: Yet without the Knowledge of a Line, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Figure can never be known, as is evident to all that know what Figures are.</p>
                  <p>This is what may in general be ſaid of Figures that are in our Hands, and before our Eyes, but if they are ſuppoſed at a diſtance from us, how great a Change ſhould we find in the Projection they make upon the bottom of our Eyes? I'm unwilling to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them here, they are eaſily Learn'd in any Book of Opticks, or by examining Figures in Picture: For ſince Painters are oblig'd to change them almoſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60613:40"/>every where that they may appear Natural, and to Paint, for Example, Circles like Ellipſes, 'tis an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Mark of our Errors, in ſeeing Objects which are not Painted; but theſe Errors are corrected by new Senſations, which may be look'd upon as a kind of <hi>Natural Judgments,</hi> and which might be call'd the Judgments of the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>When we behold a Cube,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of certain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which guard us from Error.</hi>
                     </note> for Example, 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that all the ſides, or Images of equal bigneſs with them, are never Projected on the bottom of our Eyes, ſince the Image of every one of theſe ſides which is Painted upon the Retina, or Optic Nerve, is exactly like a Cube Painted in Perſpective; nevertheleſs, we ſee them all equal, and are not deceiv'd.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be ſaid, that this happens by a kind of Judgment which we make Naturally, <hi>viz.</hi> that the moſt diſtant Faces of a Cube muſt not Project ſuch great Images, upon the bottom of the Eye, as thoſe Faces which are nearer, as the Senſes only Perceive, but never Judge, to ſpeak properly: 'Tis certain that this Judgment is nothing but a compounded Senſation, which conſequently may be ſometimes falſe.</p>
                  <p>However,
<note place="margin">V. <hi>That theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us in ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences.</hi>
                     </note> that which is nothing elſe but Senſation in us, may be conſider'd in reſpect of the Author of Nature, who excites it in us as a kind of Judgment. I ſpeak ſometimes of Senſations as of Natural Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, becauſe this way of ſpeaking ſerves to give a reaſon of Things, as may be ſeen here, in the Ninth Chapter towards the end, and in many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                  <p>Altho' theſe Judgments, which I have ſpoke of, are uſeful to correct our Senſes very many ways, and that without them we ſhould very frequently be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, yet they are alſo occaſions of Error. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, If it happens that we ſee the top of a high Steeple, behind a great Wall or a Mountain, it will appear very near to us, and very little, but if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we ſhould ſee it, at the ſame diſtance, yet with many Fields and Houſes betwixt, it would, doubtleſs, appear the greater, and at a farther diſtance,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60613:40"/>altho', in each Station, the Projection of the Rays of the Spire, or its Image, which is Painted at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of our Eyes, would be altogether the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Now, it may be ſaid, that we ſee it greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of a Judgment that we Naturally make, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſince there is ſo much Land betwixt us and the Steeple, it muſt be further, and conſequently greater.</p>
                  <p>But on the contrary, if we ſaw no Fields betwixt us and the Steeple, altho' we even knew there were many, and that it was a great way off, which is very remarkable, it would always appear very near, and very little, as I have ſaid. And it may alſo be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that this is done by a Natural Judgment of our Soul, which thus ſees this Spire, becauſe it Judges it about five or ſix hundred paces diſtant; for, common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, our Imagination does not repreſent a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, between Objects and us, if it be not aſſiſted by a Senſible view of other interjacent Objects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it can yet imagine farther.</p>
                  <p>'Tis for this cauſe,
<note place="margin">See the 9th Chapter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end.</note> that when the Moon Riſes or Sets, we ſee it greater, than when it is elevated above the Horizon, for when it is very high, we ſee no Objects betwixt it and us, whoſe greatneſs we know, to Judge of that of the Moon, by comparing them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but when it is near Setting, we ſee betwixt it and us many Fields, whoſe breadth we know very near, and ſo we Judge it at a greater diſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſee it at a greater.</p>
                  <p>It's obſervable, that when the Moon is Riſen above our Heads, altho' our reaſon aſſures us that it is at a very great diſtance, yet it ſeems to us to be very little, and very near; for, indeed, theſe Natural Judgments of Sight, are only built upon the Percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſame Sight, and Reaſon cannot correct them: So that they very often deceive us, in cauſing us to form free Judgments, which perfectly agree with them; for when we Judge by our Senſes, we are always deceiv'd, but we are never deceiv'd when we conceive, for a Body only Inſtructs as a Body, but God always teaches us Truth, as I ſhall ſhow hereafter.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:60613:41"/>
                  <p>Theſe falſe Judgments deceive us, not only as to the diſtance and bigneſs of Bodies, but alſo in making us ſee their Figure other than it is: We ſee, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the Sun and Moon, and other Spherical Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, very diſtant, as if they were Plains and Circles, becauſe, at this great diſtance, we cannot diſtinguiſh whether the oppoſite part is nearer to us than the others; and, becauſe of this, we Judge it at an equal diſtance. 'Tis for the ſame reaſon, we Judge that all the Stars, and the blue which appears in the Heaven, are at the ſame diſtance, and, as it were, a perfectly Convex Vault, becauſe our Mind ſuppoſes an Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity where it ſees no Inequality, altho' it ought not poſitively to conclude but where it ſees evidently.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not tarry here, to Explain at large the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Sight, as to the Figures of Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any Book of Optics will ſave me that Labour: This Science, indeed, does only ſhow how the Eyes are deceiv'd, and all its direction conſiſts but in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to make thoſe Natural Judgments we have ſpoke of, at ſuch time as we ought not to make them; and this may be done after ſo many ways, that there is not one Figure in the World which may not be Painted after a thouſand different manners, ſo as that the Sight will Infallibly be deceiv'd thereby. But this is not a place to Explain theſe things thorowly: what has been ſaid, is ſufficient to ſhow, that we muſt not truſt to our Eyes, when they repreſent the Figure of Bodies to us, altho' we are not ſo ſubject to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by Figures as other things.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have diſcover'd the principal and moſt general Errors of the Sight about the Extenſion of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, we muſt now correct thoſe in which it deceives us about the Motion of Matter; and this will not be a very difficult performance, after what we have ſaid about Extenſion; for there is ſo great a relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt theſe two things, that if we are deceiv'd about the bigneſs of Bodies, we muſt unavoidably be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in their Motion.</p>
                  <p>But to offer nothing except what is clear and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, we muſt firſt take away the Equivocation of the word <hi>Motion;</hi> for this Term commonly ſignifies two things, the firſt is a certain power that is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd in a mov'd Body, which is the Cauſe of its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſecond is a continual removal of a Body that is departing from, or approaching to another, that is, conſider'd as in a State of Reſt.</p>
                  <p>When we ſay, for Inſtance, that a Bowle hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated its Motion to another, the word <hi>Motion</hi> is here taken in the firſt ſignification, but if it be ſaid ſimply, that a Boul is in Motion, it is taken in the ſecond Senſe. And indeed this term <hi>Motion</hi> ſignifies both the Cauſe and Effect together, which yet are in themſelves two different things.</p>
                  <p>They ſeem to me to be in the groſſeſt and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Error concerning force, who attribute to it Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the tranſportation of Bodies; theſe fine terms of <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>impreſſed Qualities,</hi> ſeem to me to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60613:42"/>only a proper Subterfuge for the Ignorance of the falſly Learn'd,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See the 3d Chapter of the Second Part,</hi> 6. <hi>l.</hi>
                     </note> and impious Libertines, as may be very eaſily proved; but this is not a fit place to treat of this force which moves Bodies, it is not viſible, and I am here ſpeaking only of the Errors of our Eyes, though I will not omit it where it is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Motion taken in the ſecond ſenſe, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of Bodies which is diſtant one from another, is ſomething that is viſible, and a fit Subject for this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>I have,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>That our Eyes do not truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſwiftneſs of Motion conſidered in it ſelf.</hi>
                     </note> I think, in the Sixth Chapter, demonſtrated that our Sight does not diſtinguiſh the Magnitude of Bodies among themſelves, but only in reſpect to the proportion they have one to another, and particularly to ours. From whence I conclude alſo, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know the true and abſolute greatneſs of their Motions, <hi>viz.</hi> of their Swiftneſs, or Slowneſs; but only the proportion theſe Motions have one to another, and chiefly with that which generally happens to our Bodies, which I prove thus:</p>
                  <p>It is certain that we cannot judge of the greatneſs of the Motion of a Body, but by the length and ſpace that the ſame Body has run through; ſo that ſince our Eyes do not diſcover to us the true Length of the Space the Body paſſes, it follows, that they cannot diſcover the true greatneſs of this Motion to us.</p>
                  <p>This Proof is only a Conſequence of what I have ſaid of Extenſion, and is evident from what I have there demonſtrated; but here is one that depends upon no previous Suppoſitions; I ſay then, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we cou'd certainly know the true greatneſs of the Space it paſſed, it wou'd not from thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     </note> that we cou'd know that of its Motion.</p>
                  <p>The greatneſs or ſwiftneſs of Motion includes two things. The firſt is the removing of a Body from one place to another, as from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>St. Germains;</hi> the ſecond is the time that is neceſſary to remove it in; Now it is not ſufficient to be exactly aſſur'd how much ſpace there is between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>St. Germains,</hi> to know if a Man went thither by a quick or ſlow
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60613:42"/>Motion; but it is alſo neceſſary to know how much time he ſpent in going thither. I grant then that the true Length of this way is known, but abſolutely deny that we can exactly know by Sight, or any other way whatſoever, the time he was in going; and the true greatneſs of duration.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that at certain times one hour appears as long as four, and on the contrary, at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, four hours will paſs inſenſibly. As for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, when we are fill'd with Joy, the time ſeems ſhort, becauſe it paſſes without our thinking of it; but when we are oppreſt with grief, or ſuffer any pain, the days then ſeem as long as whole years: The reaſon of it is, that then the Mind is tired with its duration, becauſe it is troubleſome to it, as if it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it ſelf thereto the more for knowing it better; and ſo it thinks it longer than when it is taken up with Joy, or ſome agreeable Imploy, which makes it as it were, go out of it ſelf to poſſeſs the Object of its Joy; for even as a Perſon thinks a Picture ſo much the larger, as he conſiders more attentively the leaſt things that are repreſented therein; or, as we ſhall think the Head of a Fly very great, if we diſtinguiſh all the parts thereof with a Microſcope. Thus the Mind thinks its duration ſo much the greater, as it conſiders it with more attention, and is ſenſible of all the parts thereof.</p>
                  <p>So that I doubt not but God can, after ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, apply our Minds to the parts of Duration, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in us a great number of Senſations in a very little time, as that an hour may appear as long as many Ages; for, in fine, there is not an Inſtant in Duration, as there is not an Atome in Bodies, and even as the leaſt particle of Matter may be divided <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> ſo we may likewiſe aſſign leſs and leſs parts of Duration to Infinity, as may eaſily be demonſtrated. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mind was attentive to theſe little parts of Duration, by ſuch Senſations as leave ſome Traces in the Brain, which it can remember, it wou'd think it without doubt much longer then they otherwiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:60613:43"/>
                  <p>But indeed the uſe of Watches ſufficiently prove that we have no exact knowledge of Duration, and that is as much as I require; for as we cannot know the greatneſs of Motion in it ſelf, ſo we can no more know that of Duration, as we have ſhew'd: It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then, that if we cannot exactly know the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute greatneſs of Duration, we cannot preciſely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the abſolute greatneſs of Motion.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we may know ſome proportions of Durations, or of the times one to another, we may alſo know ſome proportions that Motions bear to one another, even as we can know that the Solar year is longer than the Lunar; thus we may alſo know that a Cannon Bullet moves faſter than a Bomb; ſo that if the uſe of our Eyes is not to diſtinguiſh the abſolute greatneſs of Motion, yet by their help we can know very near the relative greatneſs, that is, the proportion which one Motion bears to another; and this is all that is neceſſary to be known for the preſervation of our Bodies.
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Example of the Error of our Eyes about the Motion or Reſt of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many Occurrences in which we clearly know that our Sight deceives us about the Motion of Bodies; It frequently happens, that thoſe which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to move, do not move, and on the contrary, thoſe which ſeem to be in reſt, are in motion; for Example, when we ſit in a Veſſel that Sails very faſt and very ſteadily, diſtant Fields and Towns appear to move, and the Veſſel to ſtand ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Thus if a Man were plac'd in the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> he would judge by his Sight that the Sun, Earth, and the other Planets, with all the fix'd Stars, revolve about him once in about 24 or 25 hours, in which time <hi>Mars</hi> turns round upon his own Axis, yet the Sun, Earth, and Stars do not turn about this Planet, ſo that this Man would ſee things as in motion which mov'd not, and would believe himſelf to be in reſt whilſt he was in motion.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſtay to explain here, how the Man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Veſſel might correct the Error of his Eyes, and how he, whom we have ſuppos'd in the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> would obſtinately perſiſt in his Error; becauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60613:43"/>it is very eaſie to know the reaſon thereof, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if we ſhould reflect upon what would hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to a Man ſleeping in a Veſſel, and who being ſuddenly awaked, and looking about him ſhould only ſee the top of the Maſt of ſome other Veſſel coming towards him, certainly if he ſaw no Sails fill'd with Wind, no Seaman at Work, and perceiv'd no agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Veſſel, nor any thing elſe of this nature, he would abſolutely doubt whether of the two Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were in Motion, in vain would he Conſult his Eyes, and even his Reaſon, to diſcover where the Motion lay.</p>

                  <p>It's evident that the Proof of all theſe Propoſitions, except the laſt, in which there's no difficulty, depends only upon one thing, that is, we can't always make a certain Judgment of the diſtance of Objects, and if ſo, it follows, that we cannot know whether <hi>C</hi> is advanc'd towards <hi>D,</hi> or whether it approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>B;</hi> and thus alſo of the other Propoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſee whether the Judgments we form about the diſtance of Objects are certain, we are only to examine the Means we are to make uſe of in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and if theſe Means are uncertain,

                     </note> we cannot judge infallibly, there are many of them, and they muſt be explain'd.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, the moſt general, and ſometimes the moſt certain way, that we have to judge of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Objects, is the Angle, which the Rays of our Eyes make, whoſe point of Concurrence is, or meaſures, the Object; When this Angle is very great, we ſee the Object very near; on the contrary, when it is very little, we ſee it very diſtant; And the Change which happens in the Situation of our Eyes, according to the Changes of this Angle, is the means whereof our

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60613:45"/>diſtance of ſome Body, in touching it with the end of theſe two Sticks, by the diſpoſition and diſtance of his hands: So it may be ſaid, that the Soul Judges of the diſtance of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject by the diſpoſition of its Eyes, which is not the ſame, when the Angle by which he ſees, is ſometimes greater,
<note place="margin">See the 4th Article of Chap. 7.</note> and ſometimes leſs, when the Object is nearer, and when it is farther off.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall be eaſily perſwaded of this, if we take the pains to make this very eaſie Experiment: Hang a Ring upon a Thread with the edge towards you, or elſe thruſt one Stick into the Earth, and take another in your Hand, which ſhall be crooked at the end, go back two or three ſteps from the Ring or the Stick, wink with one Eye, and try to put the Stick in your Hand through the Ring, or to touch the other in the Ground traverſly, about the height of your Eyes; you will be ſurpriz'd, not to be able to do that once in an hundred times, which you believe is ſo eaſie to be done. Now if you even lay by the Stick, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to put your Finger into the Ring, hanging with the edge towards you, you will find it difficult alt ho you were juſt at it.</p>
                  <p>But it muſt be well obſerv'd, that what I have ſaid about putting a crooked Stick through a Ring, or touching another Stick traverſly, will not hold, if the Eye be in a right Line with the opening of the Ring, for then there would be no difficulty in it; but it would be eaſier to effect it with one Eye ſhut, than with both the Eyes open, becauſe that would guide us.</p>
                  <p>Now it may be ſaid, that the difficulty which is found in hitting the hole of the Ring traverſly, with but one Eye open, is owing to this, that the Eye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut, the Angle, which I have ſpoken of, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; for to know the bigneſs of the Angle at the Eye, it is not ſufficient to know the length of the Baſe, and one of the Angles at the Baſe, (unleſs the other be right) but we muſt alſo know the other Angle at the Baſe, or the length of one of the ſides, which can't exactly be known, but by opening the other Eye: And thus the Soul cannot make uſe of its Natural Geometry to Judge of the diſtance of the Ring.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60613:45"/>
                  <p>The diſpoſition of the Eyes, which accompanies the Angle, form'd by the Viſual Rays that meet in the Object, is then one of the beſt, and moſt Univerſal Methods, which the Soul makes uſe of, to Judge of the diſtance of Things: If this Angle then, does not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any Senſible Change, when the Object is near, if we approach to it, or recede from it; it will follow that the Method is falſe, and that the Soul cannot make uſe of it, to Judge of the diſtance of that Object.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis very eaſie to know, that this Angle changes remarkably, when an Object that is but one Foot from our Eyes, is remov'd to four; if it be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remov'd from four to eight, the change is much leſs ſenſible, if from eight to twelve, 'tis ſtill leſs; if from a thouſand to a hundred thouſand, 'tis yet leſs. Laſtly, the change will be wholly inſenſible, if the Object were remov'd into the Imaginary Spaces; ſo that if there were a conſiderable Space betwixt A and C, the Soul could not, by this means, know whether the Object is nearer to B or D.</p>
                  <p>'Tis for this reaſon, that we ſee the Sun and Moon as if they were wrapt up in Clouds, althô they are extreamly diſtant behind them, and that we Natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe all the Stars are at an equal diſtance, and that the Comets are fix'd, or almoſt without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, towards the latter end of their Courſe: As alſo, that they wholly diſſipate after ſome Months, becauſe they remove from us, in very near a right Line, to our Eyes, and loſe themſelves in the great Spaces, whence they return not till after many Years, or even after many Ages.</p>
                  <p>To explain the ſecond way,
<note place="margin">The ſecond way of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the distance of Objects.</note> which the Soul makes uſe of, to Judge of the diſtance of Objects, we muſt know, that 'tis abſolutely neceſſary that the Figure of the Eye be different, according to the different diſtance of the Objects that we ſee; for when a Man ſees an Object near him, it's neceſſary that his Eyes were more extended than if the Object were farther off, becauſe, that to the end the Rays of this Object may meet upon the Optic Nerve, (which is neceſſary for
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60613:46"/>Viſion) the diſtance between this Nerve and the Chryſtaline Humour, muſt be the greater.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that if the Chryſtaline Humour became more Convex, when the Object is near, it would have the ſame effect as if the Eye was more extended; but it's incredible, that the Chryſtaline Humour can eaſily change its Convexity, and yet, on the other ſide, we have a very ſenſible Proof, that the Eye is extended, or drawn out in length: for Anatomy teaches us, that there are Muſcles which encompaſs the middle of the Eye, and that one may perceive the Effort of theſe Muſcles in compreſſing, or extending it when any Object is to be ſeen very near.</p>
                  <p>But 'tis not neceſſary to know here, after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner this is done, it's enough that it happens from the change of the Eye, whether it be, that the Muſcles, that environ it, compreſs it, or whether the little Nerves, that anſwer to the <hi>Ciliary</hi> Ligaments, which keep the Chryſtaline, Humour ſuſpended among the other Humours of the Eye, do relax, to encreaſe the Convexity of the Eye, or contract themſelves to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh it.</p>
                  <p>For, in fine, the change which happens, be it what it will, is only to cauſe, that the Rays of Objects may exactly meet together juſt upon the Optic Nerve. Now 'tis manifeſt, that when the Object is five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces, or ten thouſand Leagues diſtant, we ſee it with the ſame diſpoſition of the Eye, without any ſenſible change in the Muſcles which encompaſs it, or in the Nerves which anſwer to the <hi>Ciliary</hi> Ligaments of the Chryſtaline Humour; and the Rays of Objects meet very exactly upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> or Optic Nerve. Thus the Soul would Judge that Objects, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, or a hundred thouſand Leagues diſtant, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly five or ſix hundred Paces off, if it Judg'd only of their diſtance by the diſpoſition of the Eyes, which I have ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>However, 'tis certain that the Soul makes uſe of this means when the Object is near: If, for Example, an Object is but half a Foot from us, we diſtinguiſh well enough its diſtance, by the diſpoſition of the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60613:46"/>Muſcles, which compreſs our Eyes, ſo as to extend them a little; and even this diſpoſition is painful: If the Object is at the diſtance of two Foot, we yet di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it, becauſe the diſpoſition of the Muſcles is a little ſenſible, althô it is not any longer painful, but if we remove the Object to ſome conſiderable diſtance, this diſpoſition of the Muſcles becomes ſo inſenſible, that it does not in the leaſt aſſiſt us in Judging of the diſtance of the Object.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are two Means that the Soul uſes to Judge of the diſtance of Objects, which are very uſeleſs when the Object is five or ſix hundred Paces diſtant from us; and which, alſo, are not certain, althô the Object were nearer.</p>
                  <p>The third Means conſiſts in the bigneſs of the Image,
<note place="margin">The third Means to Judge of the diſtance of Objects.</note> which is Painted at the bottom of the Eye, and which repreſents the Objects as we ſee them. 'Tis granted, that this Image diminiſhes in proportion to the diſtance of the Object, but by how much the Object, that changes its diſtances removes farther off, by ſo much is the diminution leſs ſenſible: For when an Object is at ſome reaſonable diſtance, ſuppoſe five or ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces, more or leſs, in proportion to its magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, there ariſes very conſiderable alterations in its Elongation, without any ſenſible change in the Image which repreſents it, as is eaſie to be ſhowed. Thus, alſo, this third Means has the ſame defect as the two preceding.</p>
                  <p>It may be further obſerv'd, that the Soul judges not of diſtant Objects, whoſe Image is Painted very ſmall upon the Retina. For Example, when I ſee a Man, or a Tree, at the diſtance of a hundred Paces, or elſe many Stars in the Heavens, I judge not that the Man is more diſtant than the Tree, or that little Stars are farther off than the great ones, althô the Images of the Man, and little Stars, are Painted leſs upon the Retina than the Tree, or the great Stars.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the bigneſs of the Object muſt be known to judge near of its diſtance; and becauſe I know that a Houſe is greater than a Man, altho' the Image thereof be leſs than that of a Man, yet I do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60613:47"/>judge it nearer, imagine the ſame of the Stars, our Eyes repreſenting them all at the ſame diſtance, althô it be very reaſonable to believe ſome more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from us than others. Thus there are an Infinity of Objects, whoſe diſtance we cannot know, ſince there's an Infinity of them whoſe greatneſs we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of.</p>
                  <p>We alſo Judge of the diſtance of the Object,
<note place="margin">The fourth and fifth Means.</note> by the power whereby it acts upon our Eyes, becauſe a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one acts more weakly than another; alſo by the diſtinction and clearneſs of the Image which is form'd in the Eye; becauſe, when an Object is diſtant, its neceſſary that the Eye-ſight dilate, and conſequently, the Rays meet together a little confuſedly: Hence it is, that Objects which are but a little diſtinct, or ſuch as we ſee confuſedly appear diſtant from us; and on the contrary, clear and diſtinct Objects appear to be near us. It's evident enough, that theſe laſt means are not proper to Judge of the diſtance of Objects with any certainty: I ſhall not inſiſt upon the laſt of all, which is that that helps the Imagination, and which eaſily carries the Soul to Judge of very diſtant Objects.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth and principle Means conſiſts in this,
<note place="margin">The ſixth Means to Judge of the diſtance of Bodies.</note> That the Eye does not exhibit to the Soul an Object by it ſelf, and diſtinct from others, but alſo all Objects ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt us and that, which we conſider.</p>
                  <p>When, for Example, we look upon a diſtant Steeple, we commonly ſee, at the ſame time, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terjacent Fields and Houſes, and becauſe we judge of the diſtance of theſe Fields and Houſes, and ſee the Steeple is beyond them, we judge alſo that it is very diſtant, and alſo greater, than if we ſaw it alone: However, the Image thereof, which is traced at the bottom of our Eye, is always of an equal bigneſs, whether there are Fields and Houſes betwixt us or not, provided we ſee it at an equal diſtance, which is ſuppos'd. Thus we judge of the bigneſs of Objects by their imagin'd diſtance, and the Bodies betwixt us and the Object do much aſſiſt our Imagination in it, even as we judge of Duration, or the length of Time,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60613:47"/>after ſome Action done by the remembrance of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Series of Things, which we have done, or of Thoughts which we have ſucceſſively had after this Action, for 'tis all theſe Thoughts and Actions which have ſucceeded one another, that aſſiſt our Mind in judging of the length or duration of ſome Time; or, rather, a confus'd remembrance of all the ſucceſſive Thoughts about the ſame thing, is nothing elſe but our Judgment of Duration, even as a confus'd ſight of the Fields, which are betwixt us and the Steeple, is the ſame thing as our Judgment of the diſtance thereof.</p>
                  <p>Hence 'tis eaſie to know, the true Reaſon why the Moon appears greater when it riſes, than when it is much elevated above the Horizon, for when it riſes it appears many Leagues diſtant from us, and even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Senſible Horizon, or the Earth which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates our ſight, whereas we judge it to be but about half a League from us, or ſeven or eight times as high as our Houſes, when it is moſt elevated above the Horizon. Thus we judge it much greater when it is near the Horizon, than when it is very diſtant from it, becauſe we imagine it much more diſtant from us, when it riſes, than when is it very high.</p>
                  <p>It's true, there are a great many Philoſophers, who attribute what I have ſaid to the Vapours which riſe out of the Earth: I agree with them, that Vapours, refracting the Rays of Objects, make them appear the greater. I know there are more Vapours betwixt us and the Moon, when it riſes, than when it is riſen very high, and conſequently, it muſt appear ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing greater, than if it were always equally diſtant from us: However, it cannot be ſaid that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the Rays of the Moon, is the cauſe of theſe apparent Changes of its greatneſs, for this refraction hinders not, but that the Image which is traced in the bottom of our Eyes, at the riſing of the Moon, is not leſs than that which is form'd there when it has been riſen a conſiderable time.</p>
                  <p>Aſtronomers, which Meaſure the Diameters of the Planets, obſerve, that that of the Moon grows larger
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60613:48"/>in proportion to its diſtance from the Horizon, and conſequently, in proportion to its appearing leſs to us; ſo that the Diameter of the Image, Painted at the bottom of our Eyes, is leſſer when we ſee it greater. Indeed, when the Moon ariſes, it's more diſtant from us, by the Semi-diameter of the Earth, than when it is perpendicularly over our Head, which is the reaſon that its Diameter is greater than when it ariſes above the Horizon, becauſe then it approaches to us.</p>
                  <p>That then, which is the cauſe of our ſeeing it greater when it riſes, is not the refraction of its Rays, made by the Vapours coming out of the Earth, ſince the Image, which is form'd by theſe Rays, is then leſs, but it is the Natural Judgment that we make of its diſtance, becauſe it appears beyond the Earth, which we ſee very diſtant from us, as was explain'd before, and I'm ſurpriz'd that Philoſophers ſhould look upon the reaſon of this appearance, and deceit of our Eyes, to be more difficult to find out, than the greateſt Equations of Algebra.</p>
                  <p>This means of Judging of the diſtance of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by the Knowledge of the diſtance of Things, lying betwixt us and it, is of great uſe to us, when the other ways, which I have ſpoken of, fail us, for by this we can Judge, that certain Objects are diſtant from us many Leagues, which we cannot by any of the others, however, if we Examine, we ſhall find many defects in it.</p>
                  <p>For, firſt, this way ſerves only to Judge of Objects which are upon the Earth, and but very rarely, and for the moſt, very unprofitably, of Things that are in the Air, or in the Heavens. Secondly, we can't make uſe of it upon the Earth, but in things that are a very few Leagues diſtant from us. And thirdly, we muſt be aſſur'd, that there are betwixt us and the Object, neither Vallies, Mountains, or any ſuch thing, which hinders us from making uſe of this means. Laſtly, I believe there are none who have not had Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence enough, in this ſubject, to be perſwaded that it is extreamly difficult, to make a certain Judgment of the diſtance of Objects, by a ſenſible view of Things
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60613:48"/>placed betwixt them and the Object: But I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd too much already upon this head.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Means by which we Judge of the diſtance of Objects, we have obſerv'd conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in them, and may conclude, that the Judgments which are form'd upon them muſt be very uncertain.</p>
                  <p>Hence I can eaſily ſhow the Truth of the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I have advanced. I have ſuppos'd the Object at
<note n="*" place="margin">See the preceding Figure.</note> C, conſiderable diſtant from <hi>A,</hi> then it may by many ſteps advance towards <hi>D</hi> or <hi>B,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my knowing it, ſince I have no certain means to judge of its diſtance; it may even be ſuppos'd to recede towards <hi>D,</hi> when 'tis imagin'd to approach to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>B,</hi> becauſe the Image of the Object is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Painted greater upon the Optic Nerves, whether becauſe the Air, which is betwixt the Object and the Eye, cauſes a greater refraction one time than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or whether it happens, ſometimes, from the little tremblings of this Nerve; or, laſtly, whether the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the imperfect uniting of the Rays, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Optic Nerve, are diſpers'd and communicated to the parts which ought not to be affected with them, for it may happen from many different Cauſes. Thus the Image of the ſame Objects, being enlarg'd on theſe occaſions, inclines the Soul to believe the Object is near: Suppoſe as much be ſaid about the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I muſt obſerve, that it much concerns us, for the preſervation of our Life, to know well the Motion and Reſt of Bodies, in proportion to their nearneſs to us; and that it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies little, to have an exact Knowledge of the Truth of theſe Things, when they are remov'd to a great diſtance from us. This will evidently ſhow, that what I have advanc'd in general about all the Senſes, as that they do not help us to the Knowledge of Things, but in reſpect to the preſervation of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and not according to what they are in themſelves, is exactly true in this caſe; ſince we have a more exact Knowledge of the Motion, or Reſt of Bodies, in proportion to their nearneſs: and which we cou'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60613:49"/>examine by the Senſes, than when they are ſo diſtant; That the Relation they have to our Bodies ceaſes, as when they are five or ſix hundred Paces from us, if they are of an ordinary bigneſs, and even nearer than that if they are leſs; or, in fine, farther off, if they are greater.</p>

                  <p>It's true, we often ſee things which are not, and which never were; and we ought not to conclude, that a thing is without us, from hence only, that we ſee it without us; there is no neceſſary connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an Idea that is preſented to the Mind of Man, and the Exiſtence of a thing which this Idea repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents. That which happens to thoſe who ſleep, or are delirious, ſufficiently proves this; however, we can ordinarily be aſſur'd, that Extenſion, Figures and Motions, which we ſee, are without us: Theſe are
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60613:49"/>not meer imaginary things, they are real; and we are not deceiv'd if we believe they have a real Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, and which is independant of our Mind, though it's very
<note n="*" place="margin">See the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> difficult to prove it.</p>
                  <p>It is then evident, that the Judgments we make about the Extenſion, Figures, and Motions of Bodies, contain ſome Truth; but the ſame cannot be ſaid of thoſe things that belong to Light, Colours, Sapors, Odours, and all other ſenſible Qualities; for Truth is never to be found there, as we have ſhown before.</p>
                  <p>We do not here diſtinguiſh Light from Colours, becauſe we believe they are not very different, nor can be ſeparately explain'd. We ſhall be oblig'd to ſpeak of other ſenſible Qualities in General at the ſame time that we treat of theſe two, becauſe they might be explain'd from the ſame Principles. We ought to be very attentive to the things that follow, for they are of the moſt important Conſequence, and much more uſeful than thoſe things we have yet ſpoken of.</p>

                  <p>The Reader muſt alſo know, that theſe little Strings or Branches, may be affected after two ways, either at the end, which is at the extremity of the Body, or at that which is in the Brain; If theſe little Strings are ſhaken by the Action of External Bodies upon them, and this Motion is not communicated to the Brain, as it often happens in ſleep, then the Mind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives no new Senſation by that Action; but if theſe Strings are mov'd in the Brain by the Courſe of the Animal Spirits, or by ſome other Cauſe, the Soul perceives ſomething, although the parts of theſe Strings, which are out of the Brain, and which are diſpers'd through all the parts of our Bodies, be in perfect reſt, as it often happens in ſleep.</p>

If the Motion of the Fibres in my Hand is moderate, that of the Fibres of the Brain will be ſo alſo; and if the Motion is violent to break ſomething upon my Hand, it will be much ſtronger and more violent in the Brain.</p>
                  <p>Thus alſo, if I come near the Fire, the ſmall parts of Wood, which it continually, in great number, and with much violence, diſperſes, (as may be prov'd by Reaſon, though our Sight fails us in it) ſhake theſe Fibres, and communicate a part of their Motion; If this Motion, I ſay, is moderate, that of the extremity of the Fibres of the Brain which anſwer to the Hand, will be moderate; but if this Motion is violent enough in the Hand to ſeparate ſome parts, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens when a Man burns, the Motion of the Internal Fibres of the Brain will be proportionably more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.

Lib. 1.</note> informs the Soul of the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of it's Body, that there is power enough to reſiſt the impreſſion of the Object, and that it muſt not apprehend it ſelf hurt; but the Motion which accompanies Pain being a little more violent, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of breaking fome Fibre of the Body, and the Soul muſt be advertis'd by fome diſagreeable Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to take care thereof; Thus, although the Motions which paſs in the Body differ only as to more or leſs, between themſelves, yet if they are conſider'd in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the preſervation of our Life, it may be ſaid that they differ eſſentially.</p>
                  <p>Hence our Soul is ſenſible only of the Action of Objects upon the Fibres of our Fleſh; it would be of no uſe at all to it to know them, nor could it receive from them ſufficient light, to judge whether the things about us were capable of deſtroying or che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing the Oeconony of our Body; but it perceives it ſelf touch'd by theſe Senſations which differ eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; and preciſely obſerving the Qualities of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as they ſtand related to the Body, they make it to perceive very diſtinctly whether or no theſe Objects are capable of hurting it.</p>
                  <p>Beſides this, we muſt conſider, that if the Soul only perceives that which paſſes in its Hand, when burnt; if it only ſees the Motion and Separation of fome Fibres, it would not be at all concern'd, and it might even ſometimes out of Fancy and Caprice take a ſatisfaction in it, like thoſe Madmen that divert themſelves by breaking every thing to pieces in their Fury.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe, even as a Priſoner would not be uneaſie to ſee one demoliſh the Walls that confin'd him, but would even rejoyce in hopes of being deliver'd very ſoon; ſo if we only perceive the ſeparation of the parts of our Body, when we are burnt, or receive any hurt, we ſhould ſoon be perſuaded that our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60613:51"/>is not confin'd in the Body, which rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs it, and therefore we ſhould be very glad to ſee it deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is obſervable, that the Author of the Union of our Soul and Body hath, with great Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ordain'd, that we ſhould be ſenſible of pain, when there happens a change to the Body which is capable of hurting it; as when a Needle pierces the Fleſh, or Fire ſeparates fome parts thereof, and that we ſhould be ſenſible of Titillation or an agreeable Heat when theſe Motions are moderated; without perceiving either the truth of what paſſes in our Body, or the Motions of theſe Fibres of which we have already ſpoke.</p>
                  <p>Firſt; Becauſe in perceiving Pain and Pleaſure which differ otherwiſe than in the more and leſs, we more eaſily diſtinguiſh Objects which are the occaſion of them; Secondly, becauſe this way of informing us, whether we ought to unite or ſeparate from Bodies which are about us, is more ſhort, and does leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Capacity of the Mind which was made for God. Laſtly, Becauſe Pain and Pleaſure being Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of the Soul, which it perceives by means of its Body, and which affect more than the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Motion or fome Fibres, which belong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, this obliges the Mind to be much concern'd, and ſtrengthens the Union betwixt the Soul and Body of Man: From all this it is evident, that our Senſes were not given us to teach us truth, but for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Body.</p>
                  <p>What we have ſaid of Titillation and of Pain muſt be generally underſtood of all other Senſations, as will be better ſeen hereafter; We began with theſe two Senſations rather than with others, becauſe they are more lively, and help us to conceive more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly what was to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p>It is now very eaſily ſhewn how we fall into an Infinity of Errors about Light and Colours, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally about all ſenſible Qualities. Cold. Heat, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, Sapors, Sound, Pain, Titillation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if I would ſtay to particularize every one belonging
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60613:52"/>to every Object of the Senſes, whole years would not ſuffice to enumerate them, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite, I ſhall therefore content my ſelf to ſpeak of 'em in General.</p>
                  <p>In almoſt all Senſations there are four different things which are confounded,
<note place="margin">VI. <hi>Four things which are confounded in every Senſation.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe they are done all together, and as it were in an Inſtant, and this is the Principle of all the other Errors of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the <hi>Action</hi> of the Object; that is, in Heat, for Example, the Impulſion or Agitation of the Particles of Wood againſt the Fibres of the Hand.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is the <hi>Paſſion</hi> of the Organ of Senſe, that is, the Agitation of the Fibres of the Hand caus'd by that of the Particles of Fire, which Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is communicated to the Brain, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Soul would perceive nothing.</p>
                  <p>The third is the <hi>Paſſion,</hi> Senſation, or Perception of the Soul, that is, what every one feels who is near the Fire.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is the <hi>Judgment</hi> that the Soul makes, as to that which is in the Hand or in the Fire: Now this Judgment is Natural, or rather it is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Senſation: But this Senſation, or this Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgment, is almoſt always follow'd by another free Judgment, which the Soul is ſo accuſtom'd to, that it can ſcarce refrain from it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe four things are very different, as may be ſhewed, however Men do not carefully diſtinguiſh them, but are inclin'd to confound them by reaſon of the ſtrict union betwixt the Soul and Body, which hinders us from ſeparating the Properties of Matter from thoſe of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Yet it is eaſie for any Man to know, that of theſe four things which paſs in us when we perceive ſome Object, the two firſt are proper to the Body, and the two laſt to the Soul, provided he conſider a little the Nature of the Soul and Body as he ought to do, which I have ſuppos'd; But theſe things muſt be explain'd in Particulars.</p>

                     </note> is the Action of Objects upon the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fibres of our Body. It is moſt certain that there is hardly any diſtinction made between the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Soul, and this Action of the Objects; of which there needs no proof; for Example, almoſt all Men imagine, that the heat they feel is in the Fire which cauſes it; that Light is in the Air, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours upon Coloured Objects; they have no thoughts upon the Motions of fome imperceptible Bodies which cauſe theſe Senſations.</p>
                  <p>It is true,

                     </note> that they do not imagine that pain is in the Needle that pricks them, as they judge heat to be in the Fire; the reaſon is, becauſe the Needle and its Action are viſible, but the Particles of the Wood which go out from the Fire, and their Motion againſt our Hands are not ſeen; ſo that ſeeing nothing that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60613:53"/>ſtrikes our Hands when we warm our ſelves, and feeling heat, we naturally judge this heat to be in the Fire, becauſe we ſee nothing elſe there.</p>
                  <p>So that 'tis commonly true, that we attribute our Senſations to Objects, when the Cauſes of theſe Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are unknown to us, and becauſe Pain and Titi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are produced by ſenſible Bodies, as with a Needle, a Feather which we ſee and touch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre we do not judge that there is any thing like to theſe Sentiments, in thoſe Objects that cauſe them in us.</p>
                  <p>It is certain indeed,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </note> that we do not imagine that the burning is in the Fire, but only in the Hand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is cauſed by Particles of the Wood as well as the Heat, which we always attribute to the Fire. But the reaſon of it is, the burning is a kind of Pain, and having many times judged that Pain is not in the External Body which Cauſes it, we are induced alſo to make the ſame Judgment of Burning.</p>
                  <p>What further perſuades us to judge after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is, that Pain or Burning does ſtrongly apply our Soul to the affected parts of our Bodies, and that diverts us from thinking on other things. Thus the Mind unites the Senſation of burning to that Object that is neareſt to it. And becauſe we ſoon after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the burning hath left fome viſible Marks in that part where we felt the Pain, this confirms us in the Judgment we have made that the burning is in the Hand.</p>
                  <p>But this muſt not hinder us from receiving this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule, <hi>that we uſe to attribute our Senſations to Objects, every time they act upon us by the Motion of fome inviſible Particle.</hi> This is the reaſon that we ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believe that Colours, Light, Odours, Taſte, Sound, and fome other Senſations, are in the Air, or in the External Objects which cauſe them, becauſe all Senſations are produced in us by the Motion of fome Imperceptible Bodies.</p>

                     </note> is the ſhaking of the Fibres of our Nerves, which is communicated unto the Brain; and we deceive our ſelves in this, that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found this ſhaking with the Senſation of the Soul, and judge there is none when we perceive it not by the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>We confound, for inſtance, the Motion that the Fire excites in the Fibres of our Hands with the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Heat, and we ſay that the Heat is in our Hand. But becauſe we feel not the ſhaking that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects produce in the Optick Nerve, which is in the bottom of the Eye, we think that this Nerve is not ſhaken, and that it is not cover'd with the Colours that appear to us; on the contrary, we judge that 'tis only external Objects upon which theſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are diſperſed, yet we may ſee by the following Experiment, that Colours are almoſt as ſtrong and lively in the bottom of the Optick Nerve, as upon viſible Objects.</p>
                  <p>Take the Eye of an Ox that is newly killed,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which proves it.</hi>
                     </note> and ſtrip the Skins from it that are oppoſite to the Apple of of the Eye, in the place where the Optick Nerve is, and put in their room a little bit of Paper that is very thin; and place this Eye in the hole of a Window, ſo that the Apple be in the Air, and the back part of the Eye be in the Chamber, which muſt be ſhut cloſe ſo that it may be very dark; and then all the Colours of the Objects which are without the Chamber, will
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60613:54"/>appear upon the bottom of the Eye, but repreſented upſide down. And if theſe Colours ſhou'd happen not to be very lively, if the Objects which are painted at the bottom of the Eye are too near, the Eye muſt be lengthned by preſſing the ſides cloſer together, and on the contrary, it muſt be compeſs'd, if the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are too far off.</p>
                  <p>By this Experiment, 'tis plain, that we ought to judge, or be ſenſible of the Colours at the bottom of our Eyes, after the ſame manner as we judge the Heat to be in our Hand, if our Senſes were given us to diſcover the truth, and if we were guided by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Judgments we make upon the Objects of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>But to be able to give a Reaſon for the variety of our Judgments upon ſenſible Qualities, 'tis neceſſary that we conſider how ſtrictly the Soul is united to the Body, and that it is ſo ſenſualized ſince Original Sin, that many things are attributed to it which belong to the Body, and that it is now hardly to be diſtinguiſhed from it; ſo that it aſcribes to it not only all its Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we are ſpeaking of, but alſo the force of Imagining, and even ſometimes the power of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning. For there has been a great number of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers that have been ignorant and fooliſh enough to believe, that the Soul was only a more fine and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile part of the Body.</p>
                  <p>If we read <hi>Tertullian,</hi> we ſhall ſoon ſee too many proofs of what I ſay, ſince we ſhall find him of the ſame Opinion, with a great number of Authors whom he Cites. It is true in the Book <hi>of the Soul</hi> he endeavours to prove, that Faith, Scripture, and even particular Revelation oblige us to believe that the Soul is Corporeal. I will not refute theſe Opinions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have already ſuppoſed that we ought to have read fome of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> or <hi>Deſcartes</hi> Works, which wou'd have ſufficiently ſhewn the extravagancy of theſe Thoughts; and alſo wou'd have confirm'd the Mind in the diſtinction betwixt Extention and Thought, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Soul and Body.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60613:54"/>
                  <p>The Soul is then ſo blind that ſhe is ignorant of her ſelf, and does not ſee that her own Senſations belong to her.
<note place="margin">II. <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the three kinds of the Senſations of the Soul.</hi>
                     </note> To explain this we muſt diſtinguiſh three ſorts of Senſations in the Soul, ſome ſtrong and lively, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers weak and languiſhing, and ſome again in the medium between both.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrong and lively Senſations are thoſe which ſurprize the Mind, and awaken it with ſome force, becauſe they are either very agreeable, or very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, ſuch as are Pain or Pleaſure, Heat or Cold, and generally all ſuch as are not only accompanied with Impreſſions in the Brain, but alſo with ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, ſuch as are proper for the exciting the Paſſions, as ſhall afterwards be explained.</p>
                  <p>The Weak and Languiſhing Senſations are thoſe which very little affect the Soul, and which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther very agreeable, nor very troubleſome, as a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Light, all Colours, Ordinary Sounds, which are very weak, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the Medium between both I call thoſe ſort of Senſations which indifferently touch the Soul, as a great Light, a violent Sound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it is to be obſerved, that a Weak and Languiſhing Senſation may become indifferent, and afterwards ſtrong and lively. For Example, the Senſation that we have of Light is weak, when the Light of a Flambeau is weak and languiſhing, or very far from us, and afterwards this Senſation may become indifferent, if the Flambeau be brought near enough to us; and at laſt it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very ſtrong and lively, if the Flambeau be brought ſo near our Eyes that they be dazled with it, or elſe, when we look upon the Sun. Thus the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Light may be ſtrong, weak, or moderate, according to its different degrees.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are then the Judgments that our Soul makes of theſe three ſorts of Senſations,
<note place="margin">V. <hi>Errors which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our Senſations.</hi>
                     </note> wherein we may perceive, that it almoſt always blindly follows the ſenſible Impreſſions, or Natural Judgments of our Senſes, and that it is pleaſed, if we may ſo ſay, in diſperſing it ſelf over all the Objects that it conſiders, and by diveſting it ſelf to cloath them.</p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:60613:55"/>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Senſations is ſo lively and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that the Soul can ſcarce hinder it ſelf from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging, that in ſome reſpect they belong to it, ſo that it does not only judge them to be in the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but alſo believes them to be in the Members of the Body, which it conſiders as a part of it ſelf. Thus it judges that Cold and Heat are not only in the Ice and Fire, but that they are alſo in its own Hands.</p>
                  <p>The Languiſhing Senſations ſo little affect the Soul, that it does not believe them to belong to it; nor that they are either within it ſelf, or the Body, but only in the Objects: 'Tis for this reaſon that we take away Light and Colours from our Soul and Eyes, thereby to adorn External Objects with them, although Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teaches us, that they are not in the Idea we have of Matter. And Experience ſhews us we ought to judge them in our Eyes, as well as upon Objects, ſince we ſee them as well there as in the Objects, as I have proved by the Inſtance of an Oxe's Eye placed at the hole of a Window.</p>
                  <p>Now the Reaſon why all Men do not immediately ſee that Colours, Odours, Taſte, and all other Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are only Modifications of their Soul; is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have no clear Idea of our Soul. For when we know any thing by the Idea which repreſents it, we clearly know all the Modifications it can have. All Men agree, for Example, that Roundneſs is a Modification of Extenſion, by a clear Idea which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Chap.</hi> 7. 2d <hi>part of the 3d Book.</hi>
                     </note> Thus not knowing our Soul by its Idea, as I ſhall explain hereafter, but only by the Internal Sentiment we have thereof, we know not by a ſimple Sight, but only by Reaſoning, whether Whiteneſs, Light, Colours, and other Weak and Languiſhing Senſations, are not Modifications of our Soul; but for the lively Senſations, ſuch as Pain and Pleaſure, we eaſily judge they are within us becauſe we are very ſenſible that they affect us; and have no need to know them by their Ideas, to perceive they belong us.</p>
                  <p>As for Indifferent Senſations the Soul is very much perplexed with them, for on the one hand it wou'd follow the Natural Judgments of the Senſes and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60613:55"/>therefore it removes from it, as much as poſſible, theſe ſort of Senſations, to attribute them to the Objects; but on the other ſide, it cannot avoid feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within ſelf that they belong to it, eſpecially when theſe Senſations come near thoſe that I call ſtrong and lively; ſo that 'tis after this manner that it guides it ſelf in the Judgment it makes of them; if a Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affects it very much, it concludes it to be in its own Body, as well as in the Object; and if it touches it but a little, the Soul believes it only in the Object. And if this Senſation is exactly in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between the Strong and Weak, then it knows not what to determine, if it Judges by the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>For Inſtance, if one looks upon a Candle at a little diſtance, the Soul judges that the Light is only in the Object; but if the Candle is brought nearer, it judges it to be not only in the Candle, but alſo in the Eyes. But if we draw back about a foot from it, the Soul continues ſometime without judging whether or no the Light is only in the Object; never thinking, as it ought to do, that this Light is or can be, only a Propriety, or Modification of Matter, and that it is only within it ſelf; becauſe it does not think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make uſe of its Reaſon to diſcover the Truth of what appears therein, but only of the Senſes, which never diſcovers it, and are only given us for the preſervation of our Bodies.</p>
                  <p>Now why the Soul makes no uſe of her Reaſon, that is, of her Underſtanding, when ſhe conſiders an Object which may be perceived by the Senſes, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe is not affected by things that ſhe perceives by the pure Underſtanding; and that, on the contrary, ſhe is moſt lively touch'd by Senſible things; for the Soul applies it ſelf much to what affects it much, and neglects applying it ſelf to things that do not touch it. Thus ſhe almoſt always conforms her free Judgments, to the Natural Judgments of her Senſes.</p>
                  <p>To be able to Judge rightly of Light and Colours, as well as all other Senſible Qualities, we muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſtinguiſh the Senſation of Colour, from the Motion of the Optic Nerve, and by Reaſon, diſcover
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60613:56"/>that Motions and Impulſions, are Proprieties of Bodies, and that thus they may meet in Objects, and in the Organs of our Senſes; but that Light and Colours which we ſee, are Modifications of the Soul, very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from others, and of which alſo we have as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Idea's.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, for inſtance, that a Country Man ſees Colours very plainly, and diſtinguiſhes them from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that has no Colour. It is alſo as certain, that he perceives no Motion either in Coloured Objects, or in the bottom of his Eyes; and that therefore he concludes, Colour is not Motion.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe, a Country man is as ſenſible of Heat, and hath a ſufficient Knowledge to diſtinguiſh it from all things which are not Heat, and yet he does not think that 'tis only becauſe the Fibres of his Hands are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; he thinks the Heat therefore, that he feels, is not Motion, ſince his Idea's of Heat and Motion are very different, and he can have the one without the other: For there is no reaſon to be given, that a Square is not round, but only becauſe our Idea of a Square, is different from that we have of a Circle, and that we can think of the one, without thinking of the other.</p>
                  <p>There's only a little attention requiſite, to be able to know, that 'tis not neceſſary, that the Cauſe, which makes us feel ſuch or ſuch a thing, contains it in it ſelf. Thus it is not needful, that I have Light in my Hand, that I might ſee it, when I ſtrike my Eyes; nor is it neceſſary, that there ſhou'd be Heat in the Fire, to make me feel it, when I hold my Hand to it; or, that any other Senſible Quality, that I perceive, ſhou'd be in the Object; it is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that they cauſe ſome Motion in the Fibres of my Fleſh, ſo that my Soul, which is united thereto, be Modified by ſome Senſation. There is no Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between Motions and Senſations, it is true, but there is none alſo between the Body and Mind; and ſince Nature, or the Will of our Creator, has joined theſe two Subſtances together, how oppoſite ſoever they are in their Nature, it muſt not ſeem ſurprizing
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60613:56"/>if their Modifications are Reciprocal; it is neceſſary that they ſhou'd be ſo, that they may together make an entire Being.</p>
                  <p>We muſt obſerve, that our Senſes being given us for the Preſervation of our Bodies, it is very proper that they ſhou'd incline us, to make ſuch Judgments as we do of Senſible Qualities. It is much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to us, to feel Pain and Heat, as being in our Bodies, than if we Judg'd them only to be in the Objects that cauſe them, becauſe, that Pain and Heat being capable of prejudicing our Members, it is fit we ſhou'd be advertiz'd when they are affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, ſo as to prevent their being hurt by them.</p>
                  <p>But it is not ſo with Colours, they cannot eaſily hurt the bottom of the Eye where they meet together, and it is of no uſe for us to know they are Painted there. Theſe Colours are only neceſſary to diſcover Objects more diſtinctly, and that is the reaſon our Senſes induce us to attribute them only to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. So the Judgments, to which the impreſſion of our Senſes carry us, are more Juſt, if we conſider them with relation to the Preſervation of our Bodies; but nevertheleſs, they are various, and very far from the Truth, as has already been ſhown, in part, and will more evidently appear hereafter.</p>

                  <p>THE third thing that is in each of our Senſations,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>A Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</hi>
                     </note> or in what we feel, for Example, when we are near the Fire, <hi>is, a Modification of our Soul in relation to what paſſes in the Body to which it is united.</hi> This Modification is agreeable, when what paſſes in the Body is proper to aſſiſt the Circulation of the Blood, and the other Functions of Life, which is called by the Equivocal Term of Heat; and this Modification is painful, and perfectly different from the other, when what paſſes in the Body is capable of incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and burning it, that is, when the Motions that are in the Body, are capable of breaking any of its Fibres, and this is generally called Pain or Burning, and ſo of other Senſations; but theſe are the common thoughts Men have upon this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Error is, that we unreaſonably imagine we have no knowledge of our Senſations.
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That we know our own Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, better than we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we do.</hi>
                     </note> We ſee a great many Men every day who much concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to know what Pleaſure, Pain, and the other Senſations are; they grant that they are only in the Soul, and that they are but the Modifications of it. 'Tis true theſe ſort of Men are very much to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at, for being willing to learn what they cannot but know already, for it is not poſſible that a Man ſhou'd be entirely ignorant what Pain is, when he feels it.</p>
                  <p>A Perſon, for Inſtance, that burns his Hand, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes very well the Pain he feels from Light, Colour, Sound, Taſte, Smell, Pleaſure, and from all other
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60613:57"/>Pain than what he feels; He very well diſtinguiſhes it from Admiration, from Deſire, and Love; from a Square, a Circle, and Motion: in fine, he diſcerns it very different from all things which are not this Pain that he feels. Now, if he had no knowledge of Pain, I wou'd fain know how he can have any certainty, that what he feels is none of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>We have ſome knowledge therefore of what we immediately feel, when we ſee Colours, or when we have any other Senſation; and even 'tis moſt certain, that if we knew it not, we cou'd know no ſenſible Object; for 'tis evident we cou'd not diſtinguiſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from Wine, if we did not know that the Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of one of them, is different from thoſe we have of the other, and ſo of all things we know by our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that if I was preſſed and required to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain what Pain, Pleaſure, and Colour is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cou'd not do it as it ought to be done by Words; but it follows not from thence, that if I ſee Colour, or burn my ſelf, I do not know, at leaſt, after ſome manner, what I actually feel.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſon why all Senſations cannot be well explained by Words, as all other things are, is,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</hi>
                     </note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it depends upon the Will of Man, to affix the Idea's of Things to ſuch Names as they pleaſe; they may call Heaven <hi>Ouranos, Schamajim,</hi> &amp;c. as the Greeks and Hebrews did; but even thoſe Men cannot, at their pleaſure, affix their Senſations to Words, or even to any other thing; they ſee not Colours, altho' they ſpeak of them, if they open not their Eyes: They reliſh not Taſtes, if no change happens in the order of the Fibres of their Tongue or Brain. In a word, Senſations depend not upon Mans Will, and it is only he who hath made them, that preſerves them in the mutual Correſpondence that is between the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of the Soul, and thoſe of the Body; ſo that if any one ſhou'd deſire me to repreſent to him Heat or Colour, I cannot find Words for that, but I muſt impreſs in the Organs of his Senſes, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60613:58"/>to which Nature unites theſe Senſations; I muſt take him to the Fire, and ſhow him ſome Pictures.</p>
                  <p>This is the Reaſon, why 'tis impoſſible to give the Blind the leaſt Knowledge of what we mean by Red, Green, Yellow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For ſince we cannot make our ſelves be underſtood, when he that hears us, has not the ſame Idea's as we that ſpeak; It is manifeſt, that Colours not being united to the ſound of Words, or to the motion of the Nerve of the Ear, but to that of the Optic Nerve, they cannot be repreſented to the Blind, ſince their Optic Nerve cannot be ſhaken by coloured Objects.</p>
                  <p>We have then ſome Knowledge of our Senſations, let us now ſee from whence it is, that we ſeek yet to know them, and believe our ſelves ignorant thereof; this is, without doubt, the reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The Soul,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>Why it is we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine we do not know our own Senſations.</hi>
                     </note> ſince Original Sin, is become, as it were, Corporeal, by its inclination; its love, for Senſible Things, continually diminiſhes the Union, or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it hath to Intelligible Things: It is with great diſguſt, that it conceives Things which do not produce ſome Senſations in it, and it immediately cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to conſider them: It does all that is in its power, to produce ſome Images in its Brain, which repreſent them; and it is ſo much accuſtomed to this kind of Conception from our Infancy, that it even thinks it cannot know, what it cannot imagine. Yet there are many things, which not being Corporeal, cannot be repreſented to the Mind by Corporeal Images, as our Soul, with all its Modifications: But when our Soul wou'd repreſent to it ſelf its own Nature and Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it does all it can to form a Corporeal Image thereof; It ſeeks it ſelf in all Corporeal Beings, and takes it ſelf ſometimes for one, and ſometimes for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; one while for Air, and then again for Fire, or for the Harmony of the parts of its Body. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to find it ſelf amongſt Bodies, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining its own Modifications, which are its Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to be the Modifications of Bodies, we muſt not wonder if it Errs, and is intirely Ignorant of it ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:60613:58"/>
                  <p>What yet induces it further to be willing to imagine its Senſations, is, that it Judges them to be in the Objects, and that they are even Modifications there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and conſequently, that 'tis ſomething Corporeal, and which can be Imagin'd. It Judges therefore, that the Nature of its Senſations conſiſts only in the Motion that cauſes them, or in ſome other Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Body; but when it finds that which is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what it feels, which is neither Corporeal, nor can be repreſented by Corporeal Images, this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſes it, and makes it believe that it does not know its own Senſations.</p>

                  <p>The ſecond Error we are ſubject to, in reſpect to our Senſations, is our attributing them to Objects, as has already been explained in the 11th and 12th Chapters.</p>

                     </note> our Judging that every one has the ſame Senſations of the ſame Objects. For Example, we believe all Mankind that ſees the Sky, takes it to be Blue, and the Fields to be Green, and all Viſible Objects to be after the ſame manner as they appear to us; and ſo of all other Senſible Qualities of the reſt of our Senſes. Many perſons will wonder, that I ſhou'd bring ſuch things in queſtion as they have thought Indiſputable, yet I dare affirm, they have never had any reaſon to Judge of them after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they have done; and altho' I cannot Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically demonſtrate to them that they are deceived,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60613:59"/>yet I can demonſtrate, 'tis by the greateſt Chance in the World if they are not deceived. Nay, I have ſufficient Reaſons to be aſſur'd, that they certainly, are in an Error.</p>
                  <p>To know the Truth of what I advance, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what I have already proved, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is a great difference between Senſations, and the cauſes of them; for from thence we may Judge, that its poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, abſolutely ſpeaking, that the ſame Motions of the Internal Fibres of the Optic Nerve, do not cauſe the ſame Senſations in different perſons, that is, to ſee the ſame Colours; and that ſuch a Motion may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which ſhall cauſe in one the Senſation of Green, or Gray in another, or even a new Senſation, which no body before ever had.</p>
                  <p>It is certain that this may be, and that Reaſon does not demonſtrate the contrary to us, yet 'tis generally agreed, that 'tis not probable it ſhould be ſo; It is much more reaſonable to believe, that God acts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways after the ſame manner, in reſpect to the Union he hath created between our Souls and Bodies, and that he hath tyed the ſame Idea's, and the ſame Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, to like Motions of the Internal Fibres of the Brain, altho' in different Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Let us take it for granted then, as the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe Fibres, which end in the middle of the Brain, are accompanied with the ſame Senſations in all Men; ſo if it happens, that the ſame Objects produce not the ſame Motions in their Brain, by conſequence they do not excite the ſame Senſations in their Soul. Now it appears indiſputable to me, that all Mens Organs of their Senſes, not being diſpoſed after the ſame manner, they cannot receive the ſame impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the ſame Objects.</p>
                  <p>For inſtance, The blows a Porter hits himſelf over the ſides, to warm himſelf, wou'd be ſufficient to lame a great many Men: The ſame blow wou'd produce many different Motions, and by conſequence, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Senſations, in a Man of a ſtrong Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and in a Child, or a Woman, that is of a weak Conſtitution. So that there not being two Perſons in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60613:59"/>the World, who we can be certain have the Organs of their Senſes in a perfect conformity, we cannot affirm that there is two Perſons in the World who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the ſame Senſations of the ſame Objects.</p>
                  <p>This is the Original of that ſtrange variety which we meet with in the Inclinations of Men. There are ſome who love Muſick extreamly, and others who are inſenſible of it; and even amongſt thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, ſome love one kind of Muſick, and others another, according to the almoſt infinite diverſity that is found in the Fibres of the Nerve of the Ear, in the Blood, and in the Spirits. For inſtance, how great a difference there is between the Muſick of <hi>France,</hi> that of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Chineſe,</hi> and other places; and by conſequence, between the Taſtes that different Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have of different kinds of Muſick. Nay, it even happens, that at different times, by the ſame <hi>Conſorts,</hi> we receive different Impreſſions; for if the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is heated by a great quantity of agitated Spirits, we are much more pleaſed with a bold and diſſonant Muſick, than with one that is more ſweet, and more agreeable to mathematical Rules and Exactneſs. This Experience proves, and it is not very difficult to give a reaſon of it.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſame alſo of Odours, he that loves to ſmell of the Flower of an Orange, it may be cannot endure a Roſe, and the contrary.</p>
                  <p>There is likewiſe as much diverſity in Taſtes, as in any other of the Senſations; Sauces muſt be very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent equally to pleaſe different Perſons, nay, to pleaſe the ſame Perſon at different times. One loves that which is ſweet, another that which is ſowre; one thinks Wine agreeable, another hates it; and the ſame Perſon who liked it when he was well, thinks it bitter and unpleaſant when he's in a Fever; and ſo of the reſt of the Senſes: Yet all Men love Pleaſure, they all delight in agreeable Senſations, and have all, in reſpect to that, the ſame Inclination; they receive not then the ſame Senſations of the ſame Objects, fince they love them not equally.</p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60613:60"/>
                  <p>Thus, what makes one Man ſay he loves that which is ſweet, is, becauſe the Senſation he has there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is agreeable; and that which cauſes another to ſay he does not love what is ſweet, is, that indeed he has not the ſame Senſation as he that loves it: And when he ſays he loves not that which is ſweet, he does not mean he does not love to have the ſame Senſation with the other, but that he has it not: So that he ſpeaks improperly, when he ſays he loves not that which is ſweet, he ought to ſay he does not love Sugar, Hony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that every one elſe thinks to be ſweet and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that he has not the ſame Taſte as others have, becauſe the Fibres of his Tongue are otherwiſe diſpoſed.</p>
                  <p>This is a very Senſible Example: Suppoſe that of twenty Perſons, there was one amongſt them who had his Hands very cold, and knew not the Words that are made uſe of to explain the Senſations of heat and cold; and that on the contrary, all the reſt had their Hands extreamly hot. If in Winter, cold Water was carried to all of them to Waſh in, thoſe whoſe Hands were very hot, would immediately, upon waſhing one after another, ſay this Water is very cold, I don't love it; but when the other, whoſe Hands were extreamly cold, ſhould come at laſt to waſh his Hands, he wou'd ſay, on the contrary, I don't know why you don't love cold Water, for my part, I take a great deal of pleaſure in feeling the cold, and waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Hands in it.</p>
                  <p>From this Inſtance 'tis very clear, that when this laſt ſhou'd ſay I love cold, it ſhou'd ſignifie nothing elſe but that he loves heat, and feels it, whereas the others feel the contrary.</p>
                  <p>And ſo when a Man ſays, I love what is bitter, and cannot abide ſweet things, it is only to be underſtood, that he has not the ſame Senſations as thoſe who ſay they love ſweet Things, and have an averſion for whatſoever is bitter.</p>
                  <p>It is then certain, that a Senſation which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to one Perſon, is alſo to all thoſe who feel the ſame; but that the ſame Objects cauſe not the ſame
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60613:60"/>Senſation in all the World, becauſe of the different diſpoſitions of the Organs of the Senſes, which is of the higheſt conſequence to be obſerv'd, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Philoſophy and Morality.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, an Objection may here be rais'd, but 'twill be very eaſily ſolved, <hi>viz.</hi> It ſometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that perſons who extreamly love certain ſorts of Food, come afterwards to have an averſion for them, either becauſe in Eating they have found ſome Dirt in them, or have been Sick, becauſe they have Eat to exceſs of them; or elſe for ſome other reaſons. Theſe ſame Perſons ſay, they no longer love the ſame Senſations that they loved formerly, for they have them ſtill when they Eat the ſame Food, and yet they are not agreeable to them.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer to this Objection, it muſt be obſerved, that when thoſe Perſons taſte any Food that they have ſo much averſion to, they have two very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Senſations at the ſame time; they have that of the Food they Eat, according to the Objection, and they have alſo another Senſation of Diſlike, which, for inſtance, proceeds from the ſtrong Imagination they have of the Dirt in what they Eat: The reaſon of it is, that when two Motions are made in the Brain at the ſame time, the one is never excited after the other, except it be after a conſiderable time. Thus, becauſe the agreeable Senſation never comes without this other diſguſtful one, and becauſe we confound things that are produced at the ſame time, we imagine that this Senſation that was formerly agreeable to us, is now no longer ſo; Yet if it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame, it is neceſſary that it ſhould always be agreeable. So that if we imagine it is not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, 'tis becauſe it is join'd and confounded with another, that cauſes more diſtaſte than the other does of agreeableneſs.</p>
                  <p>There is more difficulty to prove that Colours, and ſome other Senſations, which I have called weak and languiſhing, are not the ſame in all Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all thoſe Senſations ſo little affect the Soul, that we cannot diſtinguiſh them ſo well as we can Taſtes,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60613:61"/>or other Senſations more ſtrong and lively, the one being more agreeable than the other; and thus to diſcover the diverſity of Senſations that are found in different Perſons, by the variety of their pleaſure or diſlike: Reaſon, which always ſhows that the other Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not the ſame in different Perſons, tells us alſo, that there will be a variety in the Senſations they have of Colours. And indeed, there is no doubt but there is much diverſity in the Organs of Sight in different Perſons, as well as in thoſe of the Ear, or the Taſte; for there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe a perfect reſemblance in the diſpoſition of the Optic Nerve in all Men, ſince there is an infinite variety in every thing in Nature, and chiefly in thoſe that are Material, 'tis therefore very probable that all Men ſee not the ſame Colours in the ſame Objects.</p>
                  <p>Yet I believe it never, or very rarely happens, that Perſons ſee White or Black to be of any other Colour than we do, altho' they do not ſee it equally White or Black: But for mixt Colours, as Red, Yellow, and Blue, and chiefly ſuch as are compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of all three, I believe there are few Perſons who have perfectly the ſame Senſation of them. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, there are ſome Perſons, who when they look upon cettain Bodies with one Eye, take them to be Yellow, and when they behold them with the other, ſee them to be Green or Blue; yet if we ſuppos'd theſe Perſons Born blind of one Eye, or with both their Eyes ſo diſpos'd, to ſee that Blue which we call Green, they wou'd believe they ſaw Objects of the ſame colour as we ſee them, becauſe by Green or Blue, they wou'd always have underſtood what they ſee Yellow or Red.</p>
                  <p>We may further prove, that all Men ſee not the ſame Objects of the ſame Colour, becauſe, according to the obſervation of ſome, the ſame Colours do not equally pleaſe all ſorts of Perſons, and if theſe Senſations were the ſame, they wou'd be equally agreeable to all Men; but becauſe very weighty doubts may be raiſed againſt the Anſwer I have given to the precedent Objection, I do not believe it ſolid enough to inſiſt upon it.</p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:60613:61"/>
                  <p>Indeed, it is very ſeldom that we are as much more pleaſed with one Colour than another, even as we are much more pleaſed with one Taſte than another? The reaſon is, the Senſations of Colours are not given us to Judge, whether or no Bodies are proper for our Nouriſhment, that is diſtinguiſhed by Pleaſure and Pain, which are the Natural Characters of Good and Evil; Objects, in reſpect to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, are neither good nor bad to Eat. If Objects appear agreeable, or diſagreeable to us, in reſpect to their Colour, their ſight wou'd be always follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the courſe of thoſe Spirits which excite, and accompany the Paſſions, ſince the Soul cannot be touched without moving it, and we ſhou'd often hate good Things, and love bad, ſo that we ſhou'd not long preſerve our lives. In fine, the Senſations of Colours are only given us to diſtinguiſh Bodies from one another, and therefore it does as well, if we ſee Herbs Red, as if we ſee them Green, provided the Perſon that ſees them Red or Green, ſees them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways after the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>But we have ſaid enough of theſe Senſations, let us now ſpeak of Natural Judgments, and the free Judgments which accompany them; which is the fourth thing that we confound with the three others, that we have already mention'd.</p>

<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that accompany our Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and which we confound with them.</hi>
                     </note> that we ſhall not meet with many Perſons that will not be offended with this General Propoſition that I here advance, <hi>viz.</hi> That we have no Senſation of External Objects, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude not one, or many Judgments; we know, very well, that the generality of the World do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that there is ſo much as one Judgment in our Senſations, either true or falſe; ſo that theſe Perſons, being ſurprized with the Novelty of this Propoſition, will ſay, without doubt, in themſelves, But how can it be? I do not Judge this Wall to be white, I ſee very well what it is: Nor do I Judge Pain to be in my Hand, I moſt certainly feel it to be there: And who can doubt of things ſo certain, if they do not feel Objects otherwiſe than I do? Indeed, their Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Prejudices which they have imbib'd from their Infancy, carries them much further, and if they do not Reproach and Contemn thoſe, whom they believe to be perſwaded of a contrary Opinion to their own, without doubt they deſerve to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Number of Moderate Perſons.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt not here ſtay to Propheſie of the ill ſucceſs of our Thoughts, it will be more to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to endeavour to produce them with the ſtrongeſt Proofs, and ſo clearly diſcover them, that they may be no ſooner well examin'd, or attentively conſider'd, but they muſt be ſubmitted to. Since 'tis ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to prove that we have no Senſation of External
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60613:62"/>Objects, which does not include ſome falſe Judgment, take it thus:</p>
                  <p>It ſeems Indiſputable to me, that our Souls do not fill thoſe vaſt Spaces which are between us and the fixt Stars, altho' it ſhou'd be granted that themſelves are extended; ſo likewiſe, it is not reaſonable to believe that our Souls are in the Firmament, when they behold the fixt Stars there: Nor is it Credible that they ſhould go out of their Bodies a thouſand Paces, to ſee Houſes at that diſtance: It is therefore neceſſary, that our Souls ſee Houſes and Stars where they are not, ſince it goes not out of the Body where it is, and yet ſees them out of it ſelf. Now as the Stars, which are immediately united to the Soul, which are thoſe only that it can ſee, are not in the Heavens; it from thence follows, that all Men who ſee Stars in the Heavens, and afterwards voluntarily Judging that they are there, make two falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof the one is Natural, and the other Free. One is a Judgment of the Senſes, or a Compounded Senſation, according to which we ought not to Judge, the other is a Free Judgment of the Will, which we cannot hinder our ſelves from making; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which we ought not to do, if we would avoid Error.</p>
                  <p>But the reaſon that we believe that theſe Stars,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of theſe falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </note> which we ſee immediately are out of the Soul, and in the Firmament, is, becauſe it is not in the power of the Soul to ſee them when it pleaſes, for it cannot perceive them, when the Motions, to which the Idea's of theſe Objects are Naturally ty'd, happen in its Brain. Now becauſe the Soul perceives not the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of its Organs, but only its own Senſations, and that it knows theſe ſame Senſations are not produced in it by its own power, it is induced to Judge that they are without, and in the cauſe which repreſents them to it; and it hath ſo often made theſe kind of Judgments, in the ſame time it perceived the Objects, that it can ſcarcely hinder it ſelf from making them.</p>
                  <p>It will be very neceſſary to explain the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I have ſaid, to ſhew the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60613:63"/>of this infinite number of little Beings, that we call Species and Idea's, which are as nothing, and which repreſent all things; that we create and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy when we pleaſe, and that our Ignorance hath made us imagine to render a Reaſon for things that we underſtand not. We ſhou'd ſhow the ſolidity of their Opinion, who believe God is the true Father of Light, who only Inſtructs all Men, without whom the moſt ſimple Truths cou'd not be Intelligible, and the Sun, tho' never ſo bright, wou'd not be ſo much as Viſible to us; who acknowledge no other Nature than the Will of God, and who, upon theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, have confeſſed that the Idea's, which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Creatures to us, are only the Perfections of God, which anſwer to theſe ſame Creatures, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them to us.</p>
                  <p>It wou'd be requiſite alſo, to ſhow the Nature of Idea's, and then it wou'd be eaſie to ſpeak more clearly of what I have mentioned, but that it wou'd carry us too far. In the third Book, theſe things ſhall be more fully explained, and order requires it ſhou'd be referred till then. It ſuffices, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, that I bring a moſt Senſible and Indiſputable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, wherein we ſhall find many Judgments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, with one and the ſame Senſation.</p>
                  <p>I believe there is no body in the World, who looks upon the Moon, but ſees it about a thouſand Paces from himſelf, and who thinks it not greater, when it Riſes or Sets, than when it is very high above the Horizon; and it may be alſo, that we only believe we ſee it greater, without thinking that we make any Judgment in its Senſation. Yet it is Indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if there was not ſome kind of Judgment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Senſation, we ſhou'd not ſee the Moon in the diſtance it appears to be: And beſides, it wou'd appear leſs to us when it riſes, than when it is got a great way above the Horizon; ſince we ſee it great when it riſes, only becauſe we believe it farther off, by a Natural Judgment, which I have ſpoken of in the 6th Chapter: But beſides our Natural Judgments, which we may look upon as compounded Senſations,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60613:63"/>there is almoſt in all our Senſations a free Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for Men not only determine by a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Judgment, that Pain, for inſtance, is in their Hand, but they alſo make a free Judgment thereof, they not only feel it there, but likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it ſo, and have ſo habituated themſelves to form ſuch Judgments, that they find it very difficult to avoid it: Yet theſe Judgments are very falſe in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, altho' very uſeful for the preſervation of Life, for our Senſes Inſtruct us only for our Bodies, and all our free Judgments, which are conformable to our Senſes, are very far from the Truth.</p>
                  <p>But that we may not leave all theſe things, without giving ſome Means to diſcover the Reaſons thereof, we muſt know that there are two ſorts of Beings; ſuch as our Soul ſees immediately, and others that it knows only through the Means of the firſt. For Inſtance, when I perceive the Sun riſing, I firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that which I ſee immediately, and becauſe I perceive that firſt Sun only, by reaſon there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without me, which produces certain Motions in my Eyes and Brain, I Judge that this firſt Sun, which is in my Soul, is without, and that it Exiſts.</p>
                  <p>It may further happen that we ſee this firſt Sun, which is intirely united to our Soul, tho' the other be not upon the Horizon, and even whether it exiſts or no; ſo we may ſee this firſt Sun greater when the other riſes, than when it is very high, and altho' it be true, that this firſt Sun that we immediately ſee, be greater than the other riſes, it follows not from thence that this other be greater, for 'tis not properly that which riſes, that we ſee, ſince it is diſtant from us many Millions of Miles, but it is that firſt that is truly greater, and ſuch as we ſee it, becauſe all things that we immediately ſee, are always what we ſee them to be, and we deceive our ſelves only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we Judge, that what we immediately ſee is in the External Object, which cauſes that Viſion in us.</p>
                  <p>So when we ſee Light, in ſeeing this firſt Sun, which is immediately united to our Mind, we do not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60613:64"/>deceive our ſelves in believing we ſee it, it is not poſſible to doubt thereof: But our Error is. our Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without any Reaſon, nay, againſt all Reaſon, that this Light, that we immediately ſee, exiſts in the Sun, which is without us: 'Tis alſo the ſame thing in reſpect to other Objects of our Senſes.
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Error is not in our Senſations, but only in our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we obſerve carefully, what has been ſaid in the beginning and continuation of this Work, we ſhall eaſily ſee, that of all things that happen in each Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, Error proceeds from the Judgments we make, by which we think that our Senſations are in the Objects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is not an Error to be ignorant, that the Action of Objects conſiſts in the Motion of ſome of their parts, and that this Motion communicates it ſelf to the Organs of our Senſes, which are the two firſt things to be obſerved in each Senſation; for there is a great deal of difference, between being ignorant of a thing, and having a falſe Notion of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we deceive our ſelves not in the third, which is properly Senſation; when we feel Heat, ſee Light, Colours, or other Objects, it is true that we ſee them, altho' at the ſame time we ſhou'd be Mad; for there is nothing more certain, than that all the Viſionaries ſee what they think they do, and their Error conſiſts only in this, that they Judge what they ſee, to exiſt truly without them, becauſe they ſee it ſo.</p>
                  <p>It is this Judgment that includes a Conſent of our Liberty, and by conſequence, that which is ſubject to Error; and we ought always to hinder our ſelves from making it, according to the Rule we have laid down in the beginning of this Book: that we ought never to Judge of any thing, when we can hinder our ſelves from it, and where Evidence and Certainty does not conſtrain us thereto, as it happens here; for altho' we feel our ſelves extreamly inclined, by a ſtrong Habit, to Judge that our Senſations are in the Objects, as that Heat is in the Fire, and Colours in Pictures, yet we ſee not that certain Evidence and Reaſon, which preſſes, and obliges us, to believe it; and thus we voluntarily ſubmit to Error, by the ill uſe that we make of our Liberty, when we freely form ſuch Judgments.</p>

                        <hi>An Explanation of the particular Errors of Sight, which may ſerve us as an Example of the General Errors of our Senſes.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Way, I believe, is now made plain, for the diſcovery of the Errors of our Senſes in general, as they have any Relation to Senſible Qualities, which have been treated on, upon the occaſion of Light and Colours, which in order ought to be firſt explained. It ſeems neceſſary now to come to particulars, and to examine ſeverally, the Errors into which every one of our Senſes betray us; but we ſhall not now enlarge upon theſe things, becauſe from what has been already ſaid, a little attention will eaſily ſupply a long Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which we ſhould be oblig'd to make: We ſhall produce only the general Errors, into which our. Sight betrays us, in reference to Light and Colours; and we doubt not, but this Example alone, will be ſufficient to inform us, of the Errors of all the other Senſes.</p>
                  <p>When we have look'd ſome time upon the Sun, this is what paſſes in our Eyes and Soul; and theſe are the Errors we fall into. Thoſe who know the firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Dioptrics,</hi> and any thing of the admirable Structure of our Eyes, are not ignorant that the Rays of the Sun are refracted in the Chryſtaline, and other Humours, and that they meet afterwards upon the Retina, or Optic Nerve, which, as it were, furniſhes with Hangings, all the bottom of the Eye, even as the Rays of the Sun, which paſs through a Convex Glaſs, meet together in the <hi>focus,</hi> at two, three, or four Fingers breadth diſtant, in proportion to its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity: Now Experience ſhows, that if one put at the <hi>focus</hi> of the Convex-Glaſs, a little piece of Stuff,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60613:65"/>or black Paper
<note n="*" place="margin">Black Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eaſily burns, but there muſt be a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Convexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to burn White Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the ſame time.</note>, the Rays of the Sun make ſo great an impreſſion upon this Stuff, or Paper, and agitate the ſmall Particles thereof, with ſo great a violence, that they break and ſeparate them from one another. In a word, they burn them, or reduce them into Smoak and Aſhes. Thus we muſt conclude, from this Experience, that if the Pupil, through which the Light paſſes, were ſo dilated, that it would permit an eaſie paſſage for the Rays of the Sun, or on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was ſo contracted as to obſtruct them, our Retina would ſuffer the ſame thing as the piece of Stuff, or black Paper, and the Fibres would be ſo very much agitated, that they would ſoon be broken and burnt. It is for this reaſon, that moſt Men are ſenſible of a Pain, if they look upon the Sun but for one moment, becauſe they cannot ſo well cloſe up the Orifice of the Pupil, but that there will enter ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rays, to agitate the Strings of the Optic Nerve with much violence, and not without danger of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                  <p>The Soul has no knowledge of what we have ſpoke, and when it looks upon the Sun, it neither perceives its Optic Nerve, nor any Motion in it; but that's not the Error, 'tis only a ſimple Ignorance: The firſt Error it falls into, is, that it Judges the Pain it feels, is in its Eye.</p>
                  <p>If immediately, after looking upon the Sun, we go into a dark place, with our Eyes open, the Motion of the Fibres of the Optic Nerve, caus'd by the Rays of the Sun, diminiſhes, and changes by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. This is all the Change that can be perceived in the Eyes, however, 'tis not what the Soul perceives there, but only a White and Yellow Light: Its ſecond Error is, it Judges that the Light it ſees is in the Eyes, or upon the next Wall.</p>
                  <p>In fine, the agitation of the Fibres of the Retina, always diminiſhes, and ceaſes by little and little; for when a Body has been ſhaken, nothing can be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in it but a diminution of its Motion, but 'tis not that which the Soul perceives in its Eyes, it ſees the White become an Orange colour, afterwards Red,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:60613:65"/>and then Blue; And the reaſon of this Error is, that we Judge there are changes in our Eyes, or upon the next Wall, that differ much, as to the more or leſs, becauſe the Blue, Orange, and Red Colours, which we ſee, differ much otherwiſe among themſelves beſides in the more and leſs.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome Errors which we are ſubject to in reference to Light and Colours; and theſe Errors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get many others, which ſhall be explain'd in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chapters.</p>

It reſts now to ſhow, that Men uſe theſe general Errors as inconteſtable Principles, by which they will explain all things, that they draw an Infinity of falſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from them, which alſo, in their turns, ſerve for Principles to draw other Conſequences; and that thus, by little and little, they have compos'd Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Sciences, that have nothing of ſubſtance or reality in them, and which they follow with a blind impetuoſity; but which, like Phantaſms, exhibit to thoſe that embrace them only confuſion, and the ſhame of being ſeduc'd, or that Character of Folly, which makes us take pleaſure in feeding upon Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60613:66"/>and Chimera's. But this muſt be particulariz'd in ſome Examples.</p>
                  <p>It has been already ſaid, that we are accuſtom'd to attribute our own Senſations to Objects, and that we judge Colours, Odours, Sapours, and other Senſible Qualities, to be in Objects that are Colour'd, Odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We have diſcover'd that this is an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; we muſt now ſhow that we make uſe of this Error, as a Principle whence we draw our falſe Conſequences, which Conſequences we alſo eſteem as other Principles, upon which we build our Reaſonings. In a word, we muſt here explain in what order the Mind proceeds, in ſearching out ſome ſpecial Truths; where this falſe Principle, <hi>viz. Our Senſations are in Objects,</hi> is once ſo imbib'd, that it looks upon it as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable.</p>
                  <p>But to render this more Senſible, let us take ſome particular Body, whoſe Nature we would enquire into, and let us ſee, for Example, what a Man would do, that ſhould apply himſelf to know the Nature of Honey and Salt: The firſt thing, would be to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Colour, Smell, Taſte, and other Senſible Qualities; what thoſe of the Honey are, and what thoſe of the Salt; in what they agree, and in what they differ; and what Relation they can have with the Qualities of other Bodies: This being done, I believe he would reaſon much after this manner, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing he believ'd it an inconteſtable Principle, that Senſations were in Objects.
<note place="margin">The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that are attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; that theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are in the Soul.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whatever I perceive by taſting, ſeeing, and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Hony and Salt, are in this Hony and Salt. Now 'tis certain, that what I perceive in this Hony, differs eſſentially from what I perceive in this Salt; the whiteneſs of the Salt does, without doubt, differ more from the Colour of the Hony than in the <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs;</hi> and the ſweetneſs of the Hony, from the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent taſte of the Salt; and conſequently, there muſt be an eſſential difference betwixt Hony and Salt, ſince all that I am ſenſible of in both, does not only differ as to the more or leſs, but alſo eſſentially.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:60613:66"/>
                  <p>This would be the firſt ſtep this Man would make; for doubtleſs, he cannot judge that Hony and Salt differ eſſentially, but becauſe there are ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in the one, eſſentially different from the other: I mean, the Senſations that he has of Hony, differ eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially from thoſe of Salt, ſince he only judges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by the Impreſſions they make upon the Senſes; he then looks upon this Conſequence as a new Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, from whence he draws other concluſions after this manner.</p>
                  <p>Since then the Hony and Salt,

So that it's neceſſary there ſhou'd be ſome ſubſtance, which being join'd to the firſt common Matter of all different Bodies, conſtitutes their eſſential difference from one another.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſecond advance which this Man would make, and this is the happy diſcovery of <hi>ſubſtantial Forms:</hi> Theſe are the fruitful ſubſtances which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce every thing in Nature, altho' they only ſubſiſt in the Imagination of our Philoſophers. But let us ſee the Properties which he will liberally beſtow upon this Entity of his Invention, for no doubt but he will diſpoil other Subſtances, of their eſſential Properties, to Cloath this.</p>
                  <p>Since then,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of all other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Errors in the</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics <hi>of the Schools.</hi>
                     </note> there are in every Natural Body two Subſtances which compoſe it; one which is common to Hony, Salt, and other Bodies; the other which makes Hony to be Hony, Salt, Salt, and other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to be what they are. It follows that the firſt, which is Matter, having no contrariety, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to all Forms, muſt reſt without any force or action, becauſe it has no need of defending it ſelf;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60613:67"/>but for others, which are ſubſtantial Forms, they have need of being always accompanied with Qualities and Faculties to defend them; they muſt always be upon their Guard, for fear of being ſurprized; they muſt perpetually look to their own Preſervation, extend their Empire over their Neighbouring Matter, and puſh their Conqueſts as far as they can, for if they were weak and actionleſs, other Forms would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them, and ſoon annihilate them; they muſt then always fight, and nouriſh theſe Antipathies, and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Hatreds, againſt other Hoſtile Forms which endeavour to deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>If it happens that one Form ſhou'd take the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of another Form; As if, for Example, the form of a Carcaſs ſeize the Body of a Dog, this form muſt not be barely contented to annihilate the form of a Dog, its hatred muſt alſo extend to the deſtruction of all thoſe qualities which its Enemy had; the hair of the Carcaſs muſt forthwith wax white, with a white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a new creation; the Blood muſt be red after ſuch a manner, as we cannot ſuſpect it to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit, and the whole Body muſt be cover'd with qualities that are faithful to the new form, and defend it according to the little power which the qualities of a dead Body have, which muſt alſo be deſtroy'd in their turn: But becauſe they cannot always fight, and becauſe all things ſeek reſt, it's certainly neceſſary that the Fire, for inſtance, have its Center, whether it always tends by its lightneſs, and natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may once be at reſt, and burn no more, and that it may even lay by its heat, which it only kept here below for its defence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are a few of the Conſequences which reſult from this laſt Principle, that there are Subſtantial Forms, which we have made our Philoſopher conclude with a little too much liberty, for theſe are uſually deliver'd with a graver Air.</p>
                  <p>There are yet an Infinity of other Conſequences, which every Philoſopher is continually making ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Humour and Inclination, according to the Fruitfulneſs or Barrenneſs of his Imagination; for
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60613:67"/>theſe are the only things which make them differ from one another. We muſt not ſtop here, to overthrow theſe Chimerical Subſtances, other Perſons have ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently examin'd them, and ſhown that there are no ſuch things in Nature, and that they ſerve only to afford a very great number of ridiculous, and even contradictory Conſequences. We are ſatisfy'd that we have diſcover'd their Original in the Mind of Man, and to have ſhow'd that they are all owing, at this time, to the common Prejudice, That <hi>Senſations are in the Objects perceived:</hi> For, if what has been ſaid, be conſider'd with little attention, <hi>viz.</hi> That it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for the preſervation of our Body, to have Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are eſſentially different, altho' the Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which Objects make upon our Bodies, differ very little; We ſhall clearly ſee, that 'tis a fault to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſo great differences in the Objects of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt here mention, by the by, that there's nothing to be objected againſt theſe Terms, <hi>Form and Eſſential difference.</hi> Hony is certainly Hony by its form, and 'tis thus that it eſſentially differs from Salt, but this form, or this eſſential difference, conſiſts only in the different Configuration of its parts; 'tis this different Configuration which cauſes Hony to be Hony, and Salt, Salt: And altho' its only acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental to Matter in general, to have the Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts of Hony, or Salt, and ſo to have the form of Hony or Salt, it may, nevertheleſs, be ſaid, that it is eſſential to Hony or Salt, to be what they are, to have ſuch or ſuch a Configuration of Parts. Even as Senſations of Cold, Heat, Pleaſure, and Pain, are not eſſential to the Soul as a Soul, but becauſe it is by theſe Senſations, that it's ſaid to be ſenſible of Heat, Cold, Pleaſure, and Pain.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IT has been ſufficiently proved, in my Opinion, that this Prejudice, <hi>Our Senſations are in Objects,</hi> is a very fruitful Principle of Error in Phyſics; it muſt now be ſhown, from Reaſons drawn from Morals, that the ſame Prejudice join'd with this, <hi>That Objects are the only, and true Cauſes of our Senſations,</hi> is alſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dangerous.</p>
                  <p>There's nothing ſo common in the World,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample drawn from Morals, that our Senſes only offer us falſe Goods.</hi>
                     </note> as to ſee Men who are Wedded to Senſible Goods: Some love Muſick, others good Eating, and others are paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for other things. Now thus they reaſon, to perſwade themſelves that all theſe Objects are Goods, <hi>viz.</hi> All theſe agreeable Taſtes which pleaſe us in Banquets, theſe Sounds which affect the Ear, and theſe other Pleaſures which we perceive upon other occaſions, are certainly included in Senſible Objects, or, at leaſt, 'tis theſe Objects that are the occaſion of them; or, in ſine, we cannot have Senſations without them. Now 'tis impoſſible to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pleaſure be Good, whether Pain be Evil; we are inwardly convinc'd thereof, and conſequently, the Objects of our Senſes are very real Goods, which we ought to enjoy that we may be happy.</p>
                  <p>This is the Reaſoning that we ordinarily,
<note place="margin">I ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in the laſt Book, in what ſenſe Objects work upon Bodies.</note> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderately make; and this is that, which inclines us to believe that our Senſations are in Objects, that Objects have in themſelves the power of making us Senſible; that we look upon things as our Goods, which are infinitely below us, which can only act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Bodies, by producing ſome Motions in their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60613:68"/>Fibres, but can never act upon our Souls, or make us ſenſible of Pleaſure or Pain.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if it is not the Soul which acts upon it ſelf, upon occaſion of what paſſes in the Body, nothing elſe but God can do it; and if it is not the Soul which cauſes Pleaſure, or Pain, according to the different ſhaking of the Fibres of its Body, as it's very likely it does not, ſince it often perceives Pleaſure and Pain without its conſent: I know no other Hand that is powerful enough to produce this Senſation in it, but that of the Author of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, there's none but God that is our true Good,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That 'tis God only who is our Good, and that all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Objects can't make us ſenſible of Pleaſure.</hi>
                     </note> 'tis he only that can affect us with all theſe Pleaſures we are capable of, and who, in his Knowledge and Love, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And theſe Pleaſures, which he hath link'd to the Motions which paſs in our Body, to make us careful of our own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, are very little, very weak, and very ſhort, altho' we are enſlav'd to them in this State whereinto Sin has reduc'd us; but the Pleaſures which he will excite in his Elect in Heaven, are infinitely greater, ſince he made us to know and love him; for accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Order of Nature, greater Goods affect us with greater Pleaſure, and ſince God is infinitely above all things, the Pleaſure of thoſe that ſhall enjoy him will certainly ſurpaſs all Pleaſures.</p>

                     </note> in reference to Good, does ſufficiently inform us of the falſneſs of the Opinions of the Stoics and Epicureans about the Supream Good: The Epicureans placed it in Pleaſure, and becauſe they felt it as well in Vice as in Vertue, and even more commonly in the firſt than the ſecond, they gave themſelves up to all ſorts of Voluptuouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt Cauſe of their Error was, that Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing falſely there was ſomething agreeable in the Objects of their Senſes, or that they were the true Cauſes of the Pleaſures they felt, and being, beſides this, convinc'd by an inward Senſation which they had in themſelves, that Pleaſure was a Good for them, or, at leaſt, for the time they enjoy'd it, they gave
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60613:69"/>themſelves up to the Government of all the Paſſions, which they apprehended would not incommode them afterwards; whereas, they ought to have conſider'd, that the Pleaſure which is felt in Senſible Things, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in theſe things as their true Cauſes, nor after any other manner; and conſequently, that Senſible Goods cannot be ſuch in reſpect of our Soul. They ſhould alſo have conſider'd the other Things which we have explain'd.</p>
                  <p>The Stoics, on the contrary, being perſwaded that Senſible Pleaſures were only in the Body, and for the Body, and that the Soul ought to have its particular Good, placed its Happineſs in Vertue. Now this is the Origine of their Errors, they believ'd that Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Pain and Pleaſures were not in the Soul, but only in the Body; they made uſe of this falſe Judgment as a Principle for other falſe Concluſions, as that Pain is not an Evil, nor Pleaſure a Good; That the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Senſe are not good in themſelves, but that they are common to Men and Beaſts: And, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, it is eaſie to ſhow, that altho' the Epicureans and Stoics were deceiv'd in many things, yet they were in the right in ſome, for the happineſs of the Happy conſiſts in an accompliſh'd Vertue; I would ſay, in the Knowledge and Love of God, and is a very great Pleaſure which continually attends them.</p>
                  <p>Let us then well remember, that external Objects include nothing, neither agreeable nor diſagreeable, that they are not the Cauſes of our Pleaſures, and that we have no reaſon either to fear or love them, but that God only is to be fear'd and lov'd, becauſe he only is able to Puniſh or Reward us, to make us Senſible of Pain or Pleaſure. In fine, 'tis only in God, and from God, that we can expect Pleaſures, for which we have ſo ſtrong, ſo natural, and ſo juſt an Inclination.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have ſufficiently explain'd the Errors of our Senſes, in reſpect of their Objects, as of Light, Colours, and other Senſible Qualities; we muſt now ſhow how they ſeduce us about Objects, to which they have no relation, by obſtructing our ſerious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and inclining us to Judge of them upon their Teſtimony. This is what deſerves very well to be Explain'd.</p>
                  <p>Attention and Application of Mind,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>That our Senſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us in things which are not Senſible.</hi>
                     </note> to the clear and diſtinct Idea's we have of Objects, is the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary thing in the World to know their Nature; for as it is impoſſible to ſee the Beauty of any Work, without opening our Eyes, and looking earneſtly upon it, ſo the Mind cannot evidently ſee the greateſt part of Things, with the Relations they have to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs it conſiders them attentively. Now 'tis certain, that nothing diverts us more from attending the clear and diſtinct Idea's of our Senſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, from removing us farther from the Truth, and alſo deceiving us.</p>
                  <p>To apprehend this Truth it's neceſſary to know, that the three ways of perceiving, <hi>viz.</hi> by the <hi>Senſes, Imaginations</hi> and <hi>Pure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> do not all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect the Soul, and conſequently, not afford the ſame equal attention to every thing it perceives by their means, for it is much affected with what touches it much, and leſs with that which touches it little.</p>
                  <p>Now that which it perceives by the Senſes, touches and engages it extreamly, but that which it knows by the Imagination affects much leſs; but what the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60613:70"/>repreſents to it, I mean, what it perceives of it ſelf independent of the Senſes and Imagination, does very ſeldom excite it. No body can doubt, but that the leaſt pain of the Senſes is more preſent to the Mind, and renders it more attentive, than the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a thing of much greater conſequence.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon of this is, that the Senſes repreſent Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as preſent, but the Imagination as abſent: Now, according to the Laws of Order, amongſt many Goods or Evils propoſed to the Soul, thoſe which are preſent touch and affect the Soul more than all the others which are abſent, becauſe it's neceſſary for the Soul to determine readily upon what is to be done in this occurrence. Thus it is much more affected with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Pricking, than with the moſt elevated Speculations; and the Pleaſures and Evils of this World, make a greater impreſſion upon it, than the terrible Pains, or infinite Pleaſures of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>The Senſes then extreamly affect the Soul with what they repreſent to it; now as it is limited, and cannot clearly conceive many things at a time, ſo it cannot clearly apprehend what the Underſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents to it, at the ſame time as the Senſes offer ſomething to its conſideration; it then forſakes the clear and diſtinct Idea's of the Underſtanding, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever proper they are to diſcover the Truth of things as they are in themſelves, and applies it ſelf only to the confus'd Idea's of the Senſes, which affect it more, and which repreſent things unto it, not as they are in themſelves, but only according to the Relation they have with its Body.</p>
                  <p>If a Man,

Thus having always a great attention for what comes by the Senſes, it very ſeldom conſiders the reaſons propos'd to it, but it is much affected with the ſenſible Pleaſure, which depends upon the Meaſure of Periods, upon the Relations of Geſtures with Words, upon the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60613:70"/>of a Face, upon the Air and Manner of one that ſpeaks; however, after it has heard, it muſt Judge, this is the Cuſtom. Thus its Judgments muſt be different, according to the diverſity of Impreſſions which it ſhall receive by the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>If, for Example, he that ſpeaks, delivers himſelf eaſily; if he keeps an agreeable Meaſure in his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, if he has the Air of a Gentleman, and a Man of Senſe, and if he is a Perſon of Quality, if he has a great Retinue, if he ſpeaks with Authority and Gravity, if others hear him with Reſpect and Silence, if he Converſes with Wits of the firſt Claſſis; in ſine, if he is happy enough to pleaſe and to be eſteemed, he ſhall have Reaſon in whatever he advances, his very Dreſs ſhall paſs for Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p>But if he is ſo unhappy, as to have the contrary Qualities, however, concludingly he demonſtrates, he ſhall prove nothing at all: Let him ſpeak the fineſt things in the World, they ſhall never be taken notice of, the attention of his Auditors being only to that which touches the Senſes; the diſguſt they ſhall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſee a Man appear deſpicably, ſhall wholly take them up, and divert that application which is due to his Thoughts; his attire ſhall make its Maſter, and every thing that he ſays, contemptible; and his way of ſpeaking being that which is peculiar to a Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Philoſopher, ſhall incline his Auditors to believe, that theſe ſublime Truths he treats of, being above their ordinary Capacity, are only delirious and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Notions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Judgments of Men, their Eyes and Ears Judge of Truth, and not of Reaſon, even in theſe very things which depend only on Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men are only affected with ſenſible and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Objects, and ſcarce ever bring with them a ſtrong and ſerious Attention for the diſcovery of Truth.

                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have ſhow'd that there are a great number of Errors, whoſe firſt Original is owing to the ſtrong application of the Soul for whatever comes by the Senſes, and the inadvertence for things which the Underſtanding repreſents to it. We have given an Example of it, drawn from the Converſation of Men, which is of very great conſequence in Morals: Here are now others, deduc'd from the Nature of Things, which its very neceſſary to obſerve in Phyſics.</p>
                  <p>One of the principal Errors that reſpects Phyſics,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Errors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                     </note> is, that Men imagine a much greater ſubſtance in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which fall under the Cognizance of their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, than others which they perceive not; the greateſt part of Men believe, that there is much more Matter in Gold and Lead than in Air or Water: And even Children, who only obſerve by their Senſes the effects of Air, commonly imagine that there is nothing real in it. Gold and Siver are very heavy, very hard and ſenſible; Water and Air, on the contrary, are inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: From thence Men conclude, that the firſt have more reality than the laſt; they judge of the Truth of Things, by the ſenſible Impreſſion which always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives us, and neglect the clear and diſtinct Idea's of the Mind which never deceive us, becauſe what is Senſible affects and touches us more, but what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible ſtupifies us. Theſe falſe Judgments reſpect the ſubſtance of Bodies; here's another which relates to the Qualities of theſe ſame Bodies.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:60613:72"/>
                  <p>Men frequently Judge,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Errors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Qualities and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                     </note> that Objects, which excite in them the moſt agreeable Senſations, are the moſt perfect and pure, without knowing in what Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and the Purity of Matter conſiſts, and even without being concerned about it.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, for Example, that Dirt is impure, and that Water is very clear and pure, but Camels who love muddy Waters, and thoſe Animals that delight in Dirt, are not of their Opinion. Theſe are Beaſts, 'tis true, but Men that love the Entrails of a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, the Excrements of a Polcat, ſay not that this is impurity, altho' they ſay the ſame of all other kinds of Animals. Laſtly, Musk and Amber are generally eſteemed of all Men, tho' they are nothing elſe but Excrements.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, Men never Judge of the Perfection of Matter and its Purity, but only in relation to their own Senſes; and thence it happens, that the Senſes being different in all Men, as has been ſufficiently explain'd, they muſt judge very differently of the Perfection and Purity of Matter. Thus the Books, which are daily Compos'd upon the Imaginary Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that are attributed to certain Bodies, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fill'd with Errors, and variety of ſtrange Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ſince the Reaſonings, which they contain, are grounded only upon the falſe, confus'd and irregular Idea's of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>Philoſophers muſt not ſay, that Matter is Pure or Impure; they know not what they preciſely mean by the Words <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Impure;</hi> they ſhould not ſpeak without knowing what they ſay: I mean, without having clear and diſtinct Idea's, which anſwer to the terms they make uſe of, for if they had join'd clear and diſtinct Idea's to each of theſe Words, they would ſee, that that which they call Pure, would very often be Impure; and that which appears to them to be Impure, would oftentimes be found very Pure.</p>
                  <p>If they would, for Example, that that Matter ſhould be the moſt Pure and Perfect, whoſe Parts are moſt thin and apt for Motion, Gold, Silver, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, would be very imperfect Bodies; Air
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60613:72"/>and Fire, contrariwiſe, would be very perfect: Fleſh beginning to corrupt, and ſmell ill, would be tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Perfection, and a noiſome Carcaſs would be more perfect than common fleſh.</p>
                  <p>But if, on the contrary, they would have it, that the moſt perfect Bodies are they, whoſe parts were moſt groſs and ſolid, and more unapt for Motion, the Earth would be more perfect than Gold, and the Air and Fire, would be the moſt imperfect of all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                  <p>But if they would not affix theſe clear and diſtinct Idea's, to the terms <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Perfect,</hi> which I have mentioned, they are at liberty to ſubſtitute others in their room; but if they only pretend to define theſe Words by ſenſible Notions, they will eternally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all things, ſince they will never fix a ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the terms which expreſſes them. All Men, as I have already prov'd, have very different Senſations of the ſame Objects; we muſt not, therefore, define Objects by the Senſations which we have of them, except we delight in obſcurity and confuſion.</p>
                  <p>But, in ſhort, I cannot ſee that there is any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not excepting even that which the very Heavens are compos'd of, that is more perfect than another: All Matter ſeems only capable of Figure and Motion, and 'tis the ſame thing to it, to have regular or ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Figures and Motions. Reaſon does not tell us, that the Sun is more Perfect or Luminous than Dirt, nor that the Beauties of our Romances and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, have any advantage over corrupted Carcaſſes, 'tis our falſe and deluſive Senſes which thus dictate to us. Whatever is objected againſt this, all Raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Exclamations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> will certainly appear ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and cold to any one, which ſhall attentively examine the Reaſons that I have brought.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who perceive, or only have Senſations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Sun full of Light, but thoſe who know how to perceive and reaſon, do not believe it, provided they uſe as much Reaſon as Senſation. I am verily perſwaded, that all thoſe who differ the moſt, as to the Teſtimony of their Senſes, would change their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60613:73"/>Opinion, if they would ſeriouſly meditate upon what has been ſaid, but they love much to indulge the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of their Senſes; they ſubject themſelves a great while to their Prejudices, they too much forget their Mind, to know that all the Perfections, which they ſeem to ſee in Bodies, are only ſuch in relation to it.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not theſe ſort of Men that I ſpeak to, I am not concern'd for their Approbation or Eſteem, they will not hear, therefore they cannot Judge; it's enough that Truth is defended and approved, by thoſe who ſeriouſly endeavour to be deliver'd from the Errors of their Senſes, and to make a good uſe of the Light of their Mind: 'Tis theſe Perſons only, would deſire to Meditate upon theſe Thoughts, with the greateſt attention they are capable of, in order to judge of them. I leave the Cauſe to them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn or approve it as Judges, becauſe that, by their Meditation, they have acquir'd to themſelves ſuch a Right of judging of the Merit, or Demerit of the Cauſe, that it cannot but in Juſtice be ſubmitted to them.</p>

I believe there is no Error we are ſubject to upon their occaſion, whoſe Cauſe may not be diſcover'd in ſome of thoſe things which have been already mention'd, if they be well examin'd.</p>
                  <p>We have alſo ſeen, that our Senſes are very faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and exact to Inſtruct in the Relations, which all Bodies, that are about us, have to one another, but that they are incapable of informing us, what Bodies are in themſelves; that, a right uſe of them, tends only to the Preſervation of our Health and Life; that we cannot ſufficiently deſpiſe them, when they arrogate Dominion over the Mind.

To doubt with Judgment and Reaſon, is not ſo ſmall a thing as People imagine, for here it may be ſaid, that there's a great difference betwixt doubting and doubting, we doubt through Paſſion and Brutality, through Blindneſs and Malice; and laſtly, through Fancy, and only becauſe we would doubt. But we doubt alſo with Prudence and Caution, with Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Penetration of Mind. Academics and Atheiſts, doubt upon the firſt grounds, true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers on the ſecond: The firſt doubt is a doubt of darkneſs, which does not conduct us into light, but always removes us from it. The ſecond doubt is begot of Light, and aſſiſts us in ſome manner to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it in its proper place.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who doubt only after the firſt manner, do not apprehend what it is to doubt with Judgment, they laugh at what <hi>Defeartes</hi> teaches us about doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60613:74"/>in the firſt of his Metaphyſical Meditations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it appears to them that he would only have them doubt out of fancy; that he would only have them ſay, in general, that our Nature is infirm, our Mind is full of blindneſs, that we muſt take great care to deface theſe prejudices, and other like things. It is not ſufficient to ſay, the Mind is weak, we muſt be ſenſible of its weakneſſes. It is not enough to ſay, it is ſubject to Error, we muſt diſcover in what our Errors conſiſt. This is what I believe has been begun in this firſt Book, by explaining the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Errors of our Senſes; I ſhall, in the ſecond, proſecute the ſame deſign, by explaining the Nature and Errors of our Imagination.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the preceeding Book we have treated of the Senſes, and have endeavoured to explain their Nature, preciſely obſerving what uſe ought to be made of them. We have diſcovered the chief, and moſt general Errors which they make us ſubject to, and have attempted ſo to limit their power, that we may expect much, and fear nothing from them, if they are always kept within theſe limits we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. In this ſecond Book, we ſhall treat of the Imagination, Natural Order obliging us to it, for there being ſo great a Relation between the Senſes and the Imagination, we ought not to ſeparate them. It will afterwards appear, that theſe two Powers differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves only as to <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſt.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:60613:76"/>
                     <p>This is the order we ſhall obſerve in this following. Treatiſe: It is divided into three Parts. In the firſt we ſhall explain the Phyſical Cauſes of the diſorder and Errors of the Imagination. In the ſecond, we ſhall make ſome application of theſe Cauſes to the moſt general Errors of the Imagination; and ſhall alſo ſpeak of what may be call'd the Moral Cauſes of theſe Errors. In the third, we ſhall ſpeak of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Communication of ſtrong Imaginations.</p>
                     <p>If the generality of thoſe things that are contain'd in this Treatiſe, are not ſo New, as what has been already ſaid in explaining the Errors of the Senſes, they will not however be of leſs uſe. Thinking Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are ſenſible enough both of the Errors, and even of the Cauſes of the Errors whereof I treat; but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few make a ſufficient reflexion thereon. I pretend not to inſtruct all the World, 'tis the Ignorant I wou'd teach, and only inform others, or rather I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour here both to inſtruct and inform my ſelf.</p>
                     <p>We have ſaid in the firſt Book,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>A gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Idea of the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
                        </note> that the Organs of our Senſes were compoſed of little Fibres, which on one ſide terminate in the outward parts of the body and skin, and on the other, at the middle of the Brain. Now theſe little Fibres may be moved two ways, either by beginning at the ends which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the Brain, or thoſe that terminate in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts of the body. The agitation of theſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres cannot be communicated unto the Brain; but the Soul muſt perceive ſomething; If this Motion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins by an impreſſion that the objects make upon the extremity of the Fibres of our Nerves, is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the Brain, then the Soul perceives and judges that what it

But if it is only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fibres which are agitated by the courſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Spirit, or by ſome other way, the Soul ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines and judges that what it imagines is not without, but within the Brain, that is, it perceives an object as abſent. This is the difference there is between Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Imagination.</p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:60613:76"/>
                     <p>But it is requiſite to obſerve, that the Fibres of the Brain, are much more agitated by the impreſſion of Objects, than by the courſe of the Spirits; and that, that is the reaſon why the Soul is made more ſenſible by external Objects, which it looks upon as preſent, and, as it were, capable of making it immediately feel either pleaſure or pain, than by the courſe of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits. Nevertheleſs, it ſometimes happens in Perſons who have their Animal Spirits very much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by Faſting, Watching, a high Fever, or by ſome violent Paſſion, that theſe Spirits move the internal Fibres of the Brain, with as much force as outward objects could do, ſo that theſe Perſons perceive what they ought only to imagine, and think they ſee thoſe objects before their Eyes, which are only in their Imagination. From whence it plainly appears, that in reſpect to what paſſes in the Body, the Senſes and Imagination differ only as to <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Leſs,</hi> as I have before advanced.</p>
                     <p>But to give a more particular and diſtinct Idea of Imagination, we muſt know, that every time there happens any change in that part of the Brain where the Nerves meet, there likewiſe happens ſome change in the Soul, that is, as we have already explain'd, if in this part there is any Motion that changes the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of its Fibres, there alſo happens ſome New per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in the Soul, and it feels or imagines ſome New thing; and the Soul can never perceive or imagine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing anew, except there be ſome change in the Fibres of this ſame part of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>So that the faculty of Imagining, or the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſts only in the power that the Soul has of forming to its ſelf Images of objects, in producing a change in the Fibres of this part of the Brain, which may be called the <hi>principal</hi> part, ſince it anſwers to all the parts of our bodies, and is the place where our Soul immediately reſides, if we may be permitted to ſay ſo.</p>
                     <p>That ſhews us very evidently, that this power which the Soul hath of forming Images includes two things, the one depending upon the Soul it ſelf, and the other
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:60613:77"/>upon the Body.
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, one Active, and the other Paſſive.</hi>
                        </note> The firſt is Action, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Will. The ſecond is the Obedience that is given to it by the Animal Spirits, which trace theſe Images, and to the Fibres of the Brain, upon which they muſt be imprinted. In this diſcourſe the name of <hi>Imagination</hi> is indifferently given to either of theſe two things, nor are they diſtinguiſhed by the words <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> which might be given to them; becauſe, by the ſenſe of what we ſhall ſpeak, may eaſily be underſtood which of the two we mean, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of the <hi>active imagination</hi> of the Soul, or <hi>paſſive imagination</hi> of the Body.</p>
                     <p>We have not yet determined in particular, what that <hi>principal</hi> part is, which we have juſt ſpoke of, Firſt, becauſe we believe it very unneceſſary. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe we have not a certain knowledge of it. And in fine, we think it better to be ſilent in a matter whoſe truth cannot here be demonſtrated to others, altho it were manifeſt to us what that <hi>principal</hi> part is.</p>
                     <p>Let it be then according to the opinion of <hi>Willis,</hi> that common Senſe reſides in thoſe two Corpuſcles he calls <hi>Corpora Striata;</hi> Let the ſinuoſity of the Brain preſerve the Species of the Memory; and let the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> body be the ſeat of the Imagination; or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Opinion of <hi>Fernellius,</hi> let us ſuppoſe it in the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> which involves the ſubſtance of the Brain, or with <hi>D'Cartes</hi> in the <hi>Glandula Pinealis;</hi> or, in fine, let it be in ſome other part, hitherto unknown, that our Soul exerciſes its principal functions, 'twill will be very indifferent to me. It ſuffices, that there is a principal part; Nay, it is abſolutely neceſſary there ſhou'd be ſuch an one, as alſo that the foundation of <hi>D'Cartes</hi> ſyſtem ſhould ſubſiſt; for it ought to be well obſerved, that althô he were deceived when he aſſures us that the Soul is immediately united to the <hi>Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Pinealis,</hi> that ought not nevertheleſs to injure the foundation of his Syſtem, from which we ſhall always gather all the uſefulneſs that can be expected from Truth, to improve our ſelves in the knowledge of Man.</p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:60613:77"/>
                     <p>Since then the Imagination conſiſts only in the power that the Soul has of forming to it ſelf Images of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by imprinting them, if we may ſo ſay,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſe of the Changes that happen in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the 2d Book.</hi>
                        </note> in the Fibres of its Brain; the more diſtinct and larger the footſteps of theſe Animal Spirits be, which are the traces of theſe Images, the more ſtrongly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Soul will imagine theſe Objects. Now even as breadth, depth, and clearneſs of the traces of any Graving, depend upon the force wherewith the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is acted, and on the Obedience that the Copper renders to the Workman; ſo the depth, and clearneſs of the Impreſſions made on the Imagination depend upon the force of the Animal Spirits, and the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Fibres of the Brain; 'tis the variety that is found in both theſe, which makes almoſt all this great difference that we obſerve in Perſons Minds.</p>
                     <p>For 'tis no difficult thing to give a reaſon for all the different Characters which we meet with in the Mind of Man. On the one ſide, through Abundance and Want, Agitation and Slowneſs, or largeneſs and ſmalneſs of the Animal Spirits; and on the other ſide, through the Delicateneſs and Courſeneſs, Humidity and Dryneſs, Flexibility or Inflexibility of the Fibres of the Brain; and in fine, through the relation that theſe Animal Spirits may have with theſe Fibres. And it would be very reaſonable for every one, firſt to endeavour to repreſent to himſelf the different Combinations of theſe things, and to apply them to all the different Diſpoſitions they meet with; becauſe it is always more uſeful, nay, even more agreeable to make uſe of our own Wit, and ſo accuſtom it of it ſelf to diſcover truth, then to ſuffer it to be ſpoiled with idleneſs, by only applying it to ſuch things as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well known and diſcover'd. Beſides, there are ſome things to be obſerved in the difference of Peoples Genii that are ſo fine and ſo delicate, that althô we may be able to diſcover and perceive them well our ſelves, yet we cannot repreſent them to, nor make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſenſible of them.</p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:60613:78"/>
                     <p>But to explain as much as poſſible, all theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that are to be obſerved in Diſpoſitions; and that very one may the more eaſily obſerve in himſelf the Cauſe of all the changes that he feels at different times, it ſeems very proper in general to examine the Cauſe of theſe Changes which happen in the Animal Spirits, and in the Fibres of the Brain; becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſhall diſcover all that are found in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>Man never continues very long in the ſame Mind; every one hath ſufficient inward proofs of his own inconſtancy, he judges of the ſame Subject ſometimes after one manner, and ſometimes after another. In a word, the Life of Man conſiſts only in a Circulation of Blood, and in another Circulation of Thoughts and Deſires; and it ſeems the beſt way of imploying his time would be, in ſeeking after the Cauſe of theſe Changes which happen to us, ſo that way to know our ſelves.</p>

<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Animal Spirits.</hi>
                        </note> that the Animal Spirits are only the moſt ſubtile and active parts of the Blood, which ſubtiliſes and agitates it ſelf chiefly by the Fermentation that it receives in the Heart, and by the violent Motion of the Muſcles, whereof this part is compoſed; that the Spirits are conducted with the moſt of the blood through the Arteries into the Brain; and that there they are ſeparated by ſome parts that are deſtined to this uſe, which are not yet agreed upon.</p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:60613:78"/>
                     <p>From hence may be concluded, that where the Blood is very ſubtile, there are much Animal Spirits, but where it is groſs there are but a ſew; that if the Blood is compoſed of ſuch parts as are eaſily received into the Heart, or very proper for Motion, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which are in the Brain, will be extreamly heated or agitated; and if on the contrary the Blood ferments not ſufficiently in the Heart, the Animal Spirits will be languiſhing without action, and without ſtrength: ſo that according to the ſolidity which ſhall be found in the parts of the Blood, the Animal Spirits ſhall be more or leſs ſolid, and conſequently have more or leſs ſtrength in their Motion. But theſe things muſt be explained more at length, by Examples and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtible Experiments, to make the truth evident.</p>
                     <p>The Authority of the Antients has not only blinded the Minds of ſome Men,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That the Chyle goes to the heart and cauſes ſome change in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
                        </note> but we may ſay it has ſhut their Eyes alſo. For many Perſons have ſtill ſuch a reſpect for their opinion, or it may be, ſo opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, that they will not ſee ſome things, which they could no longer contradict, if they would only pleaſe to open their Eyes. We may ſee every day Perſons that are much eſteemed for their Learning, who write Books and publiſh Conferences againſt the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſenſible Experiences of the Circulation of the Blood, againſt that of Weight, the Exaſtick power of the Air, and others of the like Nature. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that Mr. <hi>Pecquet</hi> has made in our time, which we make uſe of here is in the Number of thoſe that are unfortunate only, becauſe he diſcover'd it before he had grey Hairs and a venerable Beard. But we ſhall nevertheleſs make uſe of it, not fearing but there will be ſome Judicious Perſons who will not find fault with it.</p>
                     <p>According to this diſcovery the Chyle goes not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Bowels into the Liver by the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaraick Veins,</hi> as the Antients believed, but paſſes from the Bowels into the <hi>Lacteal Veins,</hi> and afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to certain receptacles where they meet, and from thence it goes by the <hi>Thoraick</hi> Duct or Canal along the <hi>Vertebres</hi> of the Back, and ſo mingles it ſelf with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60613:79"/>the Blood in the <hi>Axillary Vein,</hi> which enters into the upper part of the <hi>Vena Cava;</hi> and thus being mingled with the Blood it meets in the Heart.</p>
                     <p>From this Experiment may be concluded that the Blood thas is mingled with the Chyle, being very different from the other Blood, which has already Circulated many times through the Heart, the Animal Spirits which are only the moſt ſubtile parts thereof, will be alſo very different, in Perſons that are Faſting, and others who have juſt Eat. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, becauſe that amongſt Meats and Drinks which are generally uſed, there is great variety, and even thoſe Perſons that uſe them have bodies diverſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; two Perſons that have juſt Dined, and at the ſame Table, will feel in their faculties of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo great a variety of changes, that it would be impoſſible to deſcribe.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that thoſe who are in perfect health di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſo quick, that the entring of the Chyle into the Heart, ſcarcely augments or diminiſhes any of its heat, and hinders not the Blood from fermenting there almoſt the ſame manner, as if it entered only by it ſelf; ſo that their Animal Spirits, and by conſequence their faculty of imagining, receives very little, if any change. But for Old and infirm People, they obſerve in themſelves very ſenſible changes after they have Eat, they grow very dull and ſleepy, or at leaſt their imagination becomes very Languiſhing, and they have neither Vivacity or quickneſs left; they no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing diſtinctly, nor can they apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any thing whatſoever; in a word, they are perfectly altered from what they were before.</p>
                     <p>But that the moſt healthful and ſtrongeſt may alſo have ſenſible proofs of what we have already ſaid,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>That Wine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the ſame effect.</hi>
                        </note> they need only reflect upon what happens to them when they have drunk more Wine then they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to, or elſe by obſerving what would be the effects if they drink Wine one Meal, and Water another. For 'tis certain, that if they are not entirely ſtupid, or if their bodies are not compoſed after a very extraordinary manner, they ſhall ſoon perceive
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60613:79"/>a gayety of temper, ſome little drowſineſs, or ſome other like accident.</p>
                     <p>Wine is ſo Spiritous, that it comes near the nature of our Animal Spirits; but are theſe a little too luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſubmit to the command of the Will, becauſe of their Solidity and exceſſive Agitation. Thus even in the ſtrongeſt and moſt vigorous Men, it produces greater changes in the Imagination, and in all the parts of the body,
<note place="margin">Vinum Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator delo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus eſt.</note> then Meat or any other Liquors do. It gives us the <hi>Foil,</hi> to ſpeak with <hi>Plautus,</hi> and produces many effects in the Mind, which are not ſo advantageous as thoſe that <hi>Horace</hi> deſcribes in theſe Verſes.</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>Quid non ebrietas deſignat? Operta recludit,</l>

                     <p>It would be eaſie enough to give a reaſon of the principal effects, that the mingling of the Chyle with the Blood produces in the Animal Spirits, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the Brain, and even in the Soul it ſelf. As why Wine rejoyces us, and gives a certain Vivacity to the Wit, when it is taken with Moderation? and for ſometime beſots Men, when 'tis drank to Exceſs? From whence proceeds the heavineſs after Meals, and many other ſuch things, for which generally very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous reaſons has been given. But though we ſhall not here make a Book of Natural Philoſophy, yet it will be neceſſary to give ſome Idea of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of the Brain, or make ſome Suppoſitions as Mr. <hi>D'Cartes</hi> has done in his Treatiſe of <hi>Man,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which 'twill be impoſſible to explain our ſelves. But if one reads this Treatiſe of Monſieur <hi>D'Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> with attention, we may ſatisfie our ſelves upon theſe queſtions, becauſe he explains all theſe things, or at leaſt, gives a ſufficient light to diſcover them, as he has done by Meditation, provided one has ſome Knowledge of his <hi>PRINCIPLES.</hi>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That the Air one breaths, cauſes likewiſe ſome change in the Spirits.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE ſecond general Cauſe of the changes which happens in the Animal Spirits, is the Air we breath; for, altho' it does immediately make as ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſions as the Chyle, nevertheleſs, in ſome time, it produces the ſame effect as the Juice of our Food does preſently. This Air enters from Branches of the Wind-pipe into that of the <hi>Venous Artery,</hi> and from thence it mingles it ſelf, and ferments with the reſt of the Blood in the Heart; and according to its particular diſpoſition, and that of the Blood, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces great changes in the Animal Spirits, and by conſequence, in the faculty of Imagining.</p>
                     <p>I know that there are ſome Perſons, who do not believe that the Air mingles it ſelf with the Blood, in the Lungs and Heart, becauſe by their Eyes they cannot diſcover, in the branches of the Wind-pipe and thoſe of the <hi>Venous Artery,</hi> the paſſages whereby the Air is communicated. But we muſt not confine the Action of the Mind to that of the Senſes, it can penetrate what is impenetrable by them, and apply it ſelf to ſuch things which they cannot. 'Tis certain, that ſome parts of the Blood continually paſs from the branches of the <hi>Venous Artery,</hi> into thoſe of the Wind-pipe, as the ſmell and moiſtneſs of the breath ſufficiently proves, and yet the paſſages of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication are imperceptible; why, therefore, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the ſubtile parts of the Air paſs from the branches of the Wind-pipe into the <hi>Venous Artery,</hi> altho' the paſſages of this communication are not ſo viſible. In ſhort, more humours are evacuated by tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the imperceptible Pores of the Arteries and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60613:80"/>Skin, than by any other paſſages of the Body; and even the Pores of the moſt ſolid Metals are not ſo ſmall, but that there are Bodies in Nature ſmall enough to find a free paſſage, for otherwiſe theſe Pores would be clos'd up. It is true, that the Groſs, and branchy parts of the Air, cannot paſs through the ordinary Pores of Bodies; and that even Water, altho' very groſs, can glide through thoſe paſſages, where this Air is ſometime forced to ſtop. But we are not ſpeaking here of thoſe groſs and branchy parts of the Air; they are, it ſeems, unuſeful enough for fermentation, 'tis only of the ſmalleſt parts, ſuch as are ſwift and ſharp, that we ſpeak of, and which have none, or very ſmall branches, to ſtop them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are the moſt proper for the fermentation of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>I might, nevertheleſs, affirm, upon the Relation of <hi>Silvius,</hi> that even the groſſeſt part of the Air paſs from the Wind-pipe into the Heart, ſince he aſſures us, that he hath ſeen it paſs thither by the help of M. <hi>de Swamerdam;</hi> for it is more reaſonable to believe a Man, who ſays he has ſeen it, than a thouſand others, who only ſpeak of it by chance. It is then certain, that the moſt ſubtile parts of the Air, which we breath, enters into our Heart, and with the Blood and Chyle, maintains there that fire which gives Life and Motion to our Bodies; and that, according to their different Qualities, they produce great changes in the fermentation of the Blood, and in the Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>The truth of this is every day made evident, by the divers Humours, and different Characters of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſpoſitions that are of different Countries. For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the <hi>Gaſcons</hi> have a more lively Imagination than the <hi>Normans;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Roan, Diep,</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> differ very much among themſelves, and that much more from the <hi>Lower Normans,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>III. <hi>That all this is done without the aſſiſtance of our Will, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected without a Providence.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE third Cauſe of thoſe changes that happen to the Animal Spirits, is the moſt general and moſt active of all, becauſe it is that which produces, maintains, and fortifies all the Paſſions. To appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend which well, it's neceſſary that we know that the fifth, ſixth, and eighth pair of the Nerves, have moſt of their branches extended through the Breaſt and Belly, where they are very uſeful for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Body, but extreamly dangerous to the Soul, becauſe the action of theſe Nerves do not depend upon the Will, as thoſe do, which ſerve to move the Arms, Legs, and other external parts of the Body,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>of the change of the Spirits, caus'd by the Nerves, which go to the Lungs and Heart.</hi>
                        </note> for they act much more upon the Soul, than that does upon them.</p>
                     <p>It muſt therefore be conſider'd, that many branches of the eight pair of the Nerves, caſt themſelves amongſt the chief Fibres of all the Muſcles, which is
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:60613:81"/>the Heart; that they encompaſs its Orifices, Auricles, and Arteries; that they ſpread themſelves even in the ſubſtance of the Lungs, and ſo, by their different motions, produce very conſiderable changes in the Blood: For the Nerves, which are diſperſed through the Fibres of the Heart, cauſe it ſomerimes to extend, and then again to contract, with too much force and precipitancy, puſhing, with much violence, a great quantity of Blood towards the Head, and all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal parts of the Body; yet, ſometimes, theſe Nerves produce an effect directly contrary. And the Nerves, which encompaſs the Orifices, Auricles, and Arteries of the Heart, cauſe very near the ſame effect with thoſe Spiracles, or breathing Holes, with which the Chymiſts moderate the heat of their Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces; and as the Spouts do, which are made uſe of in Fountains, to diminiſh or encreaſe the force of the ſtream: For the uſe of theſe Nerves is diverſly to contract, or dilate the Orifices of the Heart, and ſo to haſten or retard the filling, and evacuation of the Blood, and thereby to augment of diminiſh its heat. Thus the Nerves, which are diſperſed through the Lungs, have alſo the ſame uſe; for the Lungs are compos'd only of the branches of the Wind-pipe, of the Venous Artery, and Arterious Vein, interwoven one with another; it is viſible that the Nerves, which are extended throughout the whole ſubſtance, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of them, hinders the Air from paſſing with ſo much liberty through the branches of the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and likewiſe impedes the motion of the Blood through the Venous Artery into the Arterious Vein, and ſo into the Heart. Thus theſe Nerves, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their different agitation, ſtill augment and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the heat and motion of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>In all our Paſſions, we have very ſenſible Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of theſe different degrees of heat in our Heart. Sometimes we feel it manifeſtly encreaſe and diminiſh all of a ſudden; and as we falſely judge that our Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are in the parts of our Bodies, and ſo by that means excite our Soul, as it was explained in the firſt Book, ſo almoſt all our Philoſophers have imagined,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60613:82"/>that the Heart was the principal ſeat of the Paſſions of the Soul; and this is ſtill the moſt commonly received Opinion.</p>
                     <p>Now, becauſe the faculty of Imagining receives great changes by what happens to the Animal Spirits, and that the Animal Spirits differ very much, according to the different fermentation of the Blood which is made in the Heart, it is very eaſie to diſcover why paſſionate Perſons imagine things quite after another manner, from thoſe who conſider them in cold Blood.</p>
                     <p>The other Cauſe, which contributes very much either to the augmenting, or diminiſhing theſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary fermentations of the Blood in the Heart, conſiſts in the action of many other branches of the Nerves, which we have already ſpoke of.</p>
                     <p>Theſe branches ſpread themſelves in the <hi>Liver,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">II. <hi>Of the change of the Spirits caus'd by the Nerves which go to the Liver, to the Spleen, and the reſt of the Bowels.</hi>
                        </note> which contains the moſt ſubtile part of the Blood, or what is commonly called the <hi>Bile;</hi> and in the <hi>Spleen,</hi> which contains the more groſs or <hi>Melancholy;</hi> in the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> which contains an acid Juice very proper for fermentation; In the Stomach, Bowels, and other parts which contain the Chyle: And indeed, they are diſperſed through every place which can contribute any thing to the varying the fermentation of the Blood in the Heart. Alſo, the Arteries and Veins are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to theſe Nerves, as <hi>Willis</hi> has diſcovered of the lower Trunk of the great Artery, which is ty'd to them near the Heart, of the <hi>Axillary</hi> Artery on the right ſide the <hi>Emulgent</hi> Vein, and of ſome others.</p>
                     <p>Thus the uſe of the Nerves, being diverſly to act thoſe parts to which they are join'd, it is eaſie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how the Nerve, which environs the Liver, may, in contracting it, cauſe a great quantity of <hi>Bile</hi> to run into the Veins, and into the Duct of the <hi>Bile,</hi> which being mingled with the Blood in the Veins, and with the Chyle, enters into the Heart through the Duct of the <hi>Bile,</hi> and there produces a more violent heat than ordinary.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when we are mov'd with certain Paſſions, the Blood boils in the Arteries and Veins, and this
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:60613:82"/>heat ſpreads it ſelf through the whole Body; the Head is inflamed, and filled with ſo great a number of Animal Spirits, which being too brisk, and too much agitated by their impetuous courſe, hinder the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination from repreſenting any other things, than thoſe whoſe Images they form in the Brain; that is, from thinking of any other Objects, beſides thoſe of the Paſſion which Rules.</p>
                     <p>It is the ſame of the little Nerves that go to the <hi>Spleen,</hi> or to other parts, which contain a thicker Matter, and leſs ſuſceptible of Heat and Motion; it renders the Imagination altogether languiſhing and dull, in cauſing ſome groſs Matter, and ſuch as is difficult to be put in Motion to run into the Blood.</p>
                     <p>As for thoſe Nerves which environ the Arteries and Veins, their uſe is to hinder the Blood from paſſing, and by contracting them, compel it to run into ſuch places as it finds the freeſt paſſage to: So that part of the great Artery, which ſupplies all the parts above the Heart with Blood, being connected and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by theſe Nerves, the Blood muſt neceſſarily enter into the Head in great quantities, and this way produce a change in the Animal Spirits; and, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, in the Imagination.</p>
                     <p>But it muſt be well obſerved,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>That theſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of our Will, by the order of Providence.</hi>
                        </note> that all this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed meerly by Mechaniſm: I mean, that all the different Motions of theſe Nerves, in all the different Paſſions, are not produced by the Command of the Will, but, on the contrary, are made without, nay, even contrary to its Orders: So that a Body, whoſe Soul is not ſo well diſpoſed as that of a healthful Man, ſhall be capable of all the Motions which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our Paſſions. Thus even Beaſts may have the like, altho' they ſhould be only pure Machines.</p>
                     <p>And, indeed, this ought to make us admire the incomprehenſible Wiſdom of him, who hath ſo well ordered all theſe Springs, that it is ſufficient for an Object to move the Optick Nerve after ſuch and ſuch a manner, to produce ſo many different Motions in the Heart, the other parts of the Body, and even in the Face it ſelf; for it hath lately been diſcovered, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:60613:83"/>the ſame Nerve, which extends ſome of its branches into the Heart, and into the other interior parts; alſo communicates ſome of its branches to the Eye, to the Mouth, and to the other parts of the Face: So that it cannot raiſe any Paſſion within us, but it alſo appears outwardly, becauſe there can no motion happen to the branches which go to the Heart, but it alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates it ſelf to ſome one of thoſe which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through the Face.</p>
                     <p>The Correſpondence and Sympathy which is found between the Nerves of the Face, and ſome others that anſwer to other parts of the Body, and which want a Name, is yet more remarkable, and that which produces this great Sympathy, is, that (as in the other Paſſions) the little Nerves that go to the face, are only branches of that which deſcends lower.</p>
                     <p>When we are ſurprized with any violent Paſſion, if we carefully reflect upon what we feel in our Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, and the other parts of the Body, where theſe Nerves infold themſelves, as alſo upon the changes which accompany it in the face, and if we conſider that all theſe diverſe agitations of our Nerves are wholly involuntary, and that they happen notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the reſiſtance our Will can make againſt them, we ſhall not find it ſo difficult, to ſuffer out, ſelves to be perſwaded of this plain Expoſition that has been made, of all thoſe Relations the Nerves have one to another.</p>
                     <p>But if we examine the reaſons and end of all theſe things, we ſhall find therein ſo much Order and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that but a little ſerious attention will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to convince thoſe Perſons, that are the moſt Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to <hi>Epicurus</hi> and <hi>Lucretius,</hi> that there is a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which rules the World. When I ſee a Watch. I have reaſon to conclude that there is an Intelligence, ſince it is impoſſible that Chance ſhou'd have produc'd and diſperſed all its Wheels into order. How then can it be poſſible, that Chance, and the meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether of <hi>Atoms,</hi> ſhou'd be able ſo juſtly, and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, to diſpoſe all thoſe divers Springs, as appear both in Man, and other Animals? And that Man.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:60613:83"/>and all other living Creatures, ſhou'd beget others, which bear ſuch an abſolute reſemblance to them? So it is ridiculous to think, or ſay, with <hi>Lucretius,</hi> that 'tis Chance that has form'd all the parts whereof Man is compoſed; that the Eyes were not made to ſee, but Men were induced to ſee, becauſe they had Eyes, and ſo of the other parts of the Body. Theſe are his Words:

It is true, that if once we come to affect being thought great Wits, or rather Impious, as the <hi>Epicureans</hi> have done, we ſhall immediately find our ſelves ſurrounded with darkneſs, and perceive only by falſe Lights, boldly deny thoſe things that are moſt clear, and arrogantly and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſteriouſly affirm what is moſt falſe and obſcure.</p>
                     <p>This Poet may ſerve for a proof of the blindneſs of theſe mighty Wits, for he boldly determines, tho' contrary to all appearance of Truth, upon the moſt difficult and obſcure Queſtions; and it ſeems, that he did not perceive even thoſe Idea's that are moſt clear and evident.

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have already explain'd the general Cauſes, as well external as internal, which produce any change in the Animal Spirits; and by conſequence, in the faculty of Imagining, we have ſhow'd that the external are the Food which nouriſhes us, and the Air we breath; and that the internal conſiſts in the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary agitation of certain Nerves. We know of no other general Cauſes, and even dare affirm there are none. So that the faculty of Imagining depending, in reſpect to the Body, only upon theſe two things, the Animal Spirits, and the diſpoſition of the Brain upon which they act, there remains nothing more, in order to the giving a perfect knowledge of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but only to ſhew the different changes that can happen in the ſubſtance of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>We will examine them, after we have given ſome Idea of the Memory, and of Habits; that is, of the faculty that we have of thinking of thoſe things that we have before thought of, and of acting things over again which we have already done. Order requires this Method.</p>
                     <p>For the Explanation of the Memory,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Memory.</hi>
                        </note> 'tis neceſſary to remember what has already been repeated ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times; that all our different Perceptions depend upon the changes that happen to thoſe Fibres that are in that part of the Brain in which the Soul more particularly reſides.</p>
                     <pb n="135" facs="tcp:60613:84"/>
                     <p>This only ſuppoſed, the nature of the Memory is explained; for even as the Branches of a Tree, which have continued ſometime bent in a certain form, ſtill preſerve an aptitude to be bent anew after the ſame manner: So the Fibres of the Brain, having once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived certain impreſſions by the courſe of the Animal Spirits, and by the action of Objects, along time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome facility to receive theſe ſame diſpoſitions. Now the Memory conſiſts only in this facility, ſince we think on the ſame things, when the Brain receives the ſame impreſſions.</p>
                     <p>As the Animal Spirits act ſometimes with more, and ſometimes with leſs force, upon the ſubſtance of the Brain, and that ſenſible Objects make a much greater impreſſion than the Imagination alone, it is eaſie, from thence, to diſcover why we do not equally remember all things we perceive. For example, why what one often perceives, is commonly repreſented more lively to the Soul, than what one perceives but once or twice; why we remember more diſtinctly what we have ſeen, than what we have only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined; and ſo likewiſe, why one ſhou'd know better how the Veins are diſperſed through the Liver, after having but once ſeen a diſſection of this part, than af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having many times read in a Book of Anatomy, and other like things.</p>
                     <p>But if we ſhou'd reflect upon what hath been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid of the Imagination, and the ſhort diſcourſe made on the Memory, ſuppoſing us once delivered from this prejudice, that our Brain is too ſmall to preſerve a very great number of traces and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we ſhall have the pleaſure to diſcover the cauſe of all theſe ſurprizing effects of the Memory, whereof St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſpeaks with ſo much admiration in his tenth Book of Confeſſions. We ſhall not explain theſe things more fully, becauſe 'twill be more proper for every one to examine them himſelf with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Mind, becauſe ſuch things as we diſcover by this Method, are always more agreeable, and make a deeper impreſſion on us, than what we learn from others.</p>

                        </note> it is neceſſary to know the manner how we believe the Soul moves thoſe parts of the Bodies to which it is united.</p>
                     <p>According to all appearance, there is always in certain places of the Brain, be they where they will, a great number of Animal Spirits, much agitated by the heat of the Heart from whence they come, and are ready to run into thoſe places into which they find free paſſage. All the Nerves end in the receptacle of theſe Spirits, and the Soul hath the

                        </gap>s being entered there, they ſwell them up, and by conſequence contract them. Thus they move thoſe parts to which the Muſcles are united.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not find it ſo difficult to be perſwaded, that the Soul moves the Body after the ſame manner already explained, if we obſerve, that when we have been a long time without Eating, and are willing to give certain motions to our Bodies, we cannot eſſect it, and even feel it very troubleſome to ſtand upon our feet. But if we find the means to make any thing, that is very ſpiritous, run into our Heart, as Wine, or ſome other like Nouriſhment, we are loon ſenſible that the body obeys with much more facility, and moves it ſelf after what manner we deſire: For this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment alone makes it ſeem very plain to me, That the Soul could not give Motion to the Body through the defect of Animal Spirits, and that 'tis by their means that it hath recovered its Empire over it.</p>
                     <p>Now the infiations of the Muſcles are ſo viſible, and ſo ſenſible, in the agitation of our Arms, and all the parts of our Body, and it is ſo reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that theſe Muſcles cannot be blown up, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome body enters into them, even as a Foot-ball cannot grow big and turgid, except by the Admiſſion of Air, or ſome ſuch like thing: It ſeems, I ſay, that there can remain no doubt, but that the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are puſhed from the Brain, through the Nerves into the Muſcles, to blow them up, and to produce there all the Motions that we can wiſh; for a Muſcle
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:60613:85"/>being full it is neceſſarily ſhorter then if it was empty, ſo it draws and moves the part to which it is united, as we may ſee more at large in <hi>D'Cartes</hi> Book of the <hi>Paſſions.</hi> We don't give this Explanation as perfectly demonſtrated in all its parts: For to make it entirely evident, there are ſtill many things to be wiſh'd, which 'tis almoſt impoſſible to explain. But it is alſo uſeful enough in our ſubject to know them; for whether this Explanation be true or falſe, it remains however equally uſeful to diſcover the Nature of Habits: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if the Soul does not move the Body after this manner, it neceſſarily moves it ſome other way which is very like it, from whence we may draw ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences as we ſhall make uſe of.</p>
                     <p>But in order to the purſuing our Explanation, it muſt be obſerved, that the Spirits do not always find the ways ſo open and free by which they ſhould paſs, and that makes us, for example, ſometimes have ſo much difficulty in the moving our Fingers ſo quick as is neceſſary for the playing upon Mſiucal Inſtruments, or the Muſcles that ſerve for pronounciation, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the word of a ſtrange tongue. But by little and little the Animal Spirits by their continual courſe open and clear theſe paſſages, ſo that in time one finds no longer reſiſtance. Now Habits conſiſt in this facility, that the Animal Spirits have to paſs through the Members of our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>It is very caſie, according to this Explanation, to reſolve an infinite Number of queſtions which reſpect Habits: As for Example, why Children are more capable of acquiring new Habits then older Perſons are? Why it is ſo difficult to break our ſelves of long habits? Why Men by much ſpeaking have acquired ſo great a facility to it, that they pronounce their words with an incredible ſwiftneſs, and even without thinking thereof. As it too often happens to thoſe that ſay the Prayers which they have been accuſtomed to many years, and yet to pronounce one word only, many Muſcles muſt move together, in a certain time, and order, as thoſe of the Tongue, the Lips, Throat, and Diaphragme. But one cannot with a little Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60613:86"/>ſatisfie ones ſelf about theſe queſtions and many others very curious and uſeful, but it is not neceſſary to inſiſt upon theſe things here.</p>
                     <p>It is viſible from what has been ſaid, that there is much relation between the Memory and Habits, and that in one ſenſe the Memory may paſs for a kind of Habit. For even as Corporeal Habits conſiſt in the facility that the Spirits have acquired to paſs through certain places of our Bodies, ſo the Memory conſiſts in the traces that the ſame Spirits have impreſſed on the Brain which are the cauſes of the facility we have in recalling things again to our Mind: That if there were no perceptions that depended upon the Courſe of the Animal Spirits, nor on theſe traces, there would be no difference between the Memory, and the other Habits. It is not alſo more difficult to conceive that Beaſts, although without a Soul and incapable of any perception, after their manner remember ſuch things as have made an impreſſion in their Brain, then to conceive they are capable of acquiring different Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits;

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ALL the Parts of Living Bodies are in continual Motion, both the Solid and Fluid parts, the Fleſh as well as the Blood; there is only this difference between their Motions, that that of the parts of the Blood is viſible and ſenſible, and that of the Fibres of our Fleſh is wholly imperceptible. There is then this difference between the Animal Spirits, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brain, that the Animal Spirits are very much agitated, and very fluid, and the ſubſtance of the Brain hath ſome Solidity and Conſiſtence; ſo that the Spirits divide themſelves into little parts, and in a few hours are diſſipated by tranſpiration through the Pores of thoſe Veſſels that contain them, and it very often happens that others ſucceed which do not perfectly reſemble them; but the Fibres of the Brain are not ſo eaſily diſſipated, there does not often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen any conſiderable Change in them, and their whole ſubſtance cannot be changed but after many years.</p>
                     <p>The moſt conſiderable differences that are found in a Man's Brain, during the whole Courſe of his Life, are in Infancy, at his full Strength, and in Old Age.</p>
                     <p>The Fibres of the Brain in Children are ſoft, flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and delicate, in perfect Age they become more dry, hard, and ſtrong; but in Old Age, they become wholly inflexible, groſs, and ſometimes mingled with ſuperfluous humours, that the feeble heat of this Age cannot be any longer diſſipated. For as we ſee the Fibres which compoſe the Fleſh harden in time, and that the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60613:87"/>Fleſh of a young Partridge is without diſpute more tender than that of an old one, ſo the Fibres of the Brain of a Child or Youth, will be much more ſoft and delicate, than thoſe of Perſons that are more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall ſoon ſee the reaſon of theſe Changes, if we but conſider how theſe Fibres are continually agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the Animal Spirits which run round about them in many different ways. For as the Wind drys the Earth by blowing upon it, ſo the Animal Spirits, through their continual agitation, by little and little render the greateſt part of the Fibres of Man's Brain more dry, compreſſed, and ſolid; ſo that Perſons a little advanced in Years will almoſt always have them more inflexible, then thoſe that are Younger. And for thoſe that are of the ſame Age, as Drunkards who for many years have uſed Wine to Exceſs, or ſuch Liquors as have been able to ſtupifie them, will alſo have them more ſolid and more inflexible then ſuch as are deprived of thoſe Drinks during their whole Lives.</p>
                     <p>Now the different Conſtitutions of the Brain in Children, Men at full growth, and old Men, are very conſiderable Cauſes of the difference that is obſerved in their faculty of Imagining, of which we ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſpeak.</p>

                     <p>IT is ſufficiently evident to me, that we incline to all things, and that we have a Natural relation to every thing about us that is moſt uſeful for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and conveniency of Life. But theſe relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not equal; we are more inclined to <hi>France</hi> than to <hi>China,</hi> to the Sun, than to any Star, and to our own Houſe more than to our Neighbours. There are invſible ties which unite us more ſtrictly to Men than to Beaſts; to our Relations and Friends than to Strangers; to thoſe we depend upon for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Lives, than ſuch from whom we neither fear nor hope any thing.</p>
                     <p>What is chiefly to be obſerved in this Natural U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which is between us and other Men is, that 'tis ſo much the greater as we have more need of them. Relations and Friends are ſtrictly United one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may ſay their Griefs and Miſeries are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as well as their Joys and Happineſs; for all the Paſſions and Senſations of our Friends are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to us by the impreſſion of their aſpect and air of their Face. Yet becauſe we cannot abſolutely live without them, there is alſo another ſtricter Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then that Natural and Mutual one which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and them.</p>

                        </gap> their Souls are ſeparated from their Mothers, yet their Bodies being linked together, we muſt think they have the ſame Senſations and Paſſions; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſame thoughts which are excited in the Soul by the motions that are produced in the Body.</p>
                     <p>Thus Infants ſee what their Mothers ſee, they hear the ſame Crys, receive the ſame impreſſions of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and are agitated with the ſame Paſſions. For ſince the air of a paſſionate Mans face, penetrates thoſe who look upon him, and naturally imprints in them a paſſion like that which agitates him, although the Union of the Man with thoſe that conſider him is not ſo great; it ſeems reaſonable to me to think that Mothers are capable of impreſſing upon their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren all the ſame Senſations they are affected with, and all the ſame paſſions by which they are agitated. For the body of an Infant makes but one with that of the Mothers, the Blood and Spirits are common to both, and Senſations and Paſſions are the Natural Conſequence of the Motion of the Spirits and Blood, which Motions neceſſarily Communicate themſelves from the Mother to the Child. Therefore the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſenſations, and generally all the thoughts which proceed from the body, are common both to the Mother and Child.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things appear unqueſtionable for many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and I advance them only here as a ſuppoſition agreeable to my thoughts, but ſhall ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate them hereafter: For whatſoever hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis can reſolve all difficulties that can be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, ought to paſs for an unqueſtionable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                     <p>The inviſible bonds, by which the Author of Nature unites all theſe Works, are worthy the Wiſdom of God, and admiration of Men, there is nothing that's both more ſurprizing and inſtructive together; but we
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60613:88"/>think not of it; we ſuffer our ſelves to be conducted without conſidering who it is that conducts us. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is hidden from us as well as its Author, and we feel the Motions which ſhe produces in us, without conſidering the Cauſes of 'em; yet are there few things more neceſſary to be known, for 'tis upon their knowledge that the Explanation of whatſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to Man depends.</p>
                     <p>There are certainly ſprings in our Brain which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally incline us to Imitation,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there is between our Brain and the other parts of our bodies which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to Imitation and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</hi>
                        </note> for it is very neceſſary to Civil Society. It is not only requiſite that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould believe their Fathers, Diſciples their Maſters, and Inferiors thoſe which are above them, for all Men muſt have ſome diſpoſition to take the ſame manners, and to do the ſame actions with thoſe they live with. To unite Men together there muſt be a reſemblance both of Body and Mind; this is the principle of an infinite Number of things that we ſhall afterwards treat of, but for what we ſhall ſpeak of in this Chapter, it is neceſſary that we know there is Natural diſpoſitions in the Brain which incline us to Compaſſion as well as Imitation.</p>
                     <p>We muſt then conſider, that not only the Animal Spirits carry themſelves Naturally into the parts of our Bodies, to cauſe the ſame Actions and Motions we ſee in others, but alſo in ſome manner to receive their Injuries, and to take part in their Miſeries; for Experience teaches us, that when we very attentively conſider any one that is rudely hurt, or that hath any great wound, the Spirits are carried with great force into ſuch parts of our Bodies as anſwer to thoſe that we ſee hurt in another: Provided that we do not turn the courſe of the Animal Spirits otherways, by an induſtrious and voluntary titillation of ſome other part of the body: Or except their Natural courſe to the Heart and Bowels, which is wont to happen in ſudden Motions, draw them along with it ſelf, or change that courſe which we ſpeak of: Or laſtly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome extraordinary connection with the tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>This Compaſſion in the Body, produces one in the Mind, it excites us to help and aſſiſt others, becauſe in that we relieve our ſelves; and it alſo ſtops our Malice and Cruelty; for the horrour of Blood, the fear of Death, and in a word, the ſenſible impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Compaſſion, often hinders thoſe from killing of Beaſts, who even are much perſwaded that they are only Machines, becauſe the generality of Mankind cannot kill them without hurting themſelves by the counterſtroke of Compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>What is chiefly to be obſerved here, is, that the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſight of a wound that any Perſon receives, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in thoſe that ſee it another hurt, ſo much the more ſenſible as the beholder is more weak and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; becauſe this ſenſible ſight puſhes the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with more violence into thoſe parts of the body which anſwer to what they ſee hurt, and ſo make a greater Impreſſion in the Fibres of a delicate body, than in one that is more ſtrong and robuſt.</p>

                     <p>So Men, who are ſtrong and vigorous, are not hurt by the ſight of a Murder, they are not ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to Compaſſion, becauſe this ſight offends their Bodies, but becauſe it offends their Reaſon. Theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have no pity for Criminals, they are immoveabie and inexorable. But Women and Children ſuffer much Pain by the Wounds they ſee others receive; they have a Mecanical Compaſſion for the Miſerable; Nay, they cannot ſee a Dog beat, or hear him cry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being diſturbed at it.</p>
                     <p>As for Infants who are yet in their Mothers Belly; the delicacy of the Fibres of their Fleſh, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely greater than that of Women or Children, the Courſe of the Spirits will produce more conſiderable changes in them, as we ſhall afterwards obſerve.</p>

                        <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curables</hi> a young Man who was born a Fool, and his body broken after the ſame manner as Criminals are broke on the Wheel. He had lived near twenty Years in this condition, many Perſons have ſeen him, and the late Queen-Mother going to viſit this Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal had the Curioſity to ſee him, and to touch the Arms and Legs of this young Man in the ſame places where they were broke.</p>
                     <p>According to the principles that I have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, the Cauſe of this ſad Accident was, that his Mother, who heard a Criminal was to be broken, went to ſee him executed; all the blows that this miſerable Man received, ſo ſtrongly ſmote the Imagination of this Mother, and by a kind of Counter-blow the render delicate Brain of her
<note n="*" place="margin">According to the firſt Suppoſition.</note>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:60613:90"/>Child. The Fibres of this Womans Brain were ſtrangely ſhaken, and it may be broke in ſome places by the impetuous Courſe of the Animal Spirits, cauſed by the ſight of ſo terrible an Action, but ſhe was ſtrong enough to hinder their abſolute ruine; though on the contrary, the Fibres of this Child's Brain, being not able to reſiſt the torrent of theſe Spirits, were entirely diſſipated, and the ſhock was great enough to make him wholly loſe his Wits; and this was the reaſon he came into the World deprived of his Underſtanding, this was likewiſe the cauſe that the ſame parts of his body was broken as thoſe of the Criminal, whom his Mother ſaw executed.</p>
                     <p>At the ſight of this Execution, which was ſo capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of frighting a Woman, the violent courſe of the Mothers Animal Spirits, went impetuouſly from her Brain to all the parts of her Body, which anſwer'd to thoſe of the Criminal,
<note n="*" place="margin">According to the ſecond Suppoſition.</note> and the ſame thing paſſed in the Infant. But becauſe the Bones of the Mother were able to reſiſt the Violence of theſe Spirits, they received no hurt; Nay, it may be, ſhe did feel no pain, nor the leaſt trembling in her Legs, when the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was broken; but the rapid ſtream of the Spirits was capable to ſeparate the ſoft and tender Bones of the Infant, for the Bones are the laſt parts of the Body that are formed, and they have very little conſiſtence in Infants, while they are in the Womb: And it muſt be obſerved, that if this Mother had determined the Motion of theſe Spirits to any other part of her Body by ſome violent titilation, her Child would not have had his Bones broken, but that part which had anſwer'd to that to which the Mother determined theſe Spirits, had been much hurt, as I have already ſaid.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſons of this accident may ſerve to explain in general how Women, who during their being with Child, upon ſeeing Perſons with certain Marks in their Faces, imprint the ſame on their Children, and in the ſame part of the Body. And from thence we may judge that advice very reaſonable, which bids 'em touch ſome hidden part of the Body, when they perceive any thing which ſurprizes 'em, and when
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60613:90"/>they are agitated with any violent Paſſion, for that may cauſe the Marks to be traced rather upon theſe hidden parts, than upon the Face of their Infants.</p>
                     <p>We ſhould often have inſtances like to what I have now related, if Infants could live after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch great Wounds, but generally it cauſes Abortions. For we may conclude, that almoſt all Infants who dye before they are born, except they be ſick, have no other cauſe of their Death than a fright, ſome ardent deſire, or ſome other violent paſſion of their Mothers. Here is alſo another very particular inſtance.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not above a Year ſince, that a Woman having with too much application conſider'd the Picture of Saint <hi>Pius</hi> (when the Feaſt of his Canonization was celebrated,) was brought to bed of a Child which was perfectly like the Repreſentation of this Saint. He had the Face of an Old Man, as much as it was poſſible in an Infant that has no Beard, his Arms were croſſed upon his Breaſt, his Eyes turned towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and he had a very low Forehead, becauſe the Image of this Saint being raiſed towards the Vault of the Church, and looking towards Heaven, had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt no Forehead likewiſe. He had a kind of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed Miter upon his Shoulders, with many round marks in the places where Miters are covered with Stones: And indeed this Child very much reſembled the Picture by which his Mother had formed him through the power of her Imagination. 'Tis a thing that all <hi>Paris</hi> might have ſeen as well as I, becauſe 'twas a long time preſerved in Spirits of Wine.</p>
                     <p>This inſtance is the more particular, becauſe there was not the ſight of a Man living, and agitated with ſome paſſion, who moved the Spirits and Blood of the Mother to produce ſo ſtrange an effect, but only the ſight of a Picture; which yet was very ſenſible and accompanied with a great emotion of Spirits, cauſed either through the Zeal and application of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or through the agitation that the noiſe of the Feaſt had produc'd in her.</p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:60613:91"/>
                     <p>This Mother therefore looking upon this Picture with ſome application and emotion of Spirits, the Child, according to the firſt ſuppoſition, ſaw it as ſhe did with the ſame application and emotion of Spirits. The Mother being lively affected imitated him at leaft in the Poſture, according to the ſecond Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for her body being entirely formed, and the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of her Fleſh hard enough to reſiſt the courſe of the Spirits, ſhe could not imitate or make her ſelf like to him in all things; but the Fibres of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant's Fleſh being extreamly ſoft, and conſequently ſuſceptible of all ſorts of impreſſions, the violent courſe of the Spirits, produced in his Fleſh whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was neceſſary to make him entirely like the Image that he ſaw, and the imitation to which Children are much more diſpoſed, perfected it as much as poſſible; but this imitation having given to the body of this Child a figure ſo very extraordinary, it was alſo the cauſe of its Death.</p>
                     <p>There are many other Examples in Authors, of the power of the Imagination of Mothers, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo fantaſtical but has cauſed Abortions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. For they not only make Children deformed, but alſo marked with ſuch Fruits as they have longed for, as Plumbs, Pears, Grapes, and ſuch like things. For inſtance. ſome Mothers having a ſtrong Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to eat Pears, the Children imagine and deſire them with the ſame ardour, and the courſe of the Spirits excited by the image of this deſired fruit, diſpoſing it ſelf through the little body, is able to change its ſigure, becauſe of its ſoſtneſs: So that theſe poor Children become like thoſe things they wiſh'd for with ſo much ardour. But the Mothers ſuffer no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, becauſe their bodies are not ſoft enough to take the figure of ſuch things as they imagine: Thus they cannot imitate them, or render themſelves entirely like 'em.</p>
                     <p>Now, it muſt not be imagined that this Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that I have explained, and which is ſometimes the cauſe of ſuch great diſorder, is uſeleſs or ill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Nature; for on the contrary, it ſeems very
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60613:91"/>uſeful in the Propagation of Humane Bodies, or in the formation of the <hi>Foetus;</hi> and it is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the tranſmitting certain diſpoſitions of the Brain, which ought to be different, at different times, and in different Countrys. For inſtance, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite in ſome Countrys that Lambs ſhould have their Brains to diſpoſed as to fly at the ſight of a Wolf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are many of 'em there, and they have a great deal to fear from them.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that this Communication of the Mothers Brain with her Infants, has ſometimes ill conſequences, when the Mothers ſuffer themſelves to be ſurprized by any violent paſſion. Yet it ſeems to me, that without this Communication Women and Animals could not eaſily beget young ones of the ſame kind; for although ſome reaſon might be given of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the <hi>Foetus</hi> in general, as <hi>D'Cartes</hi> has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily enough attempted: However 'tis very difficult, without this Communication of the Mothers Brain with the Childs, to explain how a Mare ſhould not beget an Ox, or an Hen lay an Egg which contains a little Partridge, or ſome Foul of a new kind; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe that have conſidered the ſormation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> will be of this opinion.</p>
                     <p>The moſt reaſonable thought, and that which is moſt conformable to experience about this difficule queſtion of the formation of the <hi>Foetus,</hi> is, that Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are perfectly formed, even before the action by which they are conceived, and that their Mothers only contribute to their growth whilſt they continue in the Womb. However, this Communication of Animal Spirits, and of the Mothers Brain with the Spirits and Brain of the Child, ſeems ſtill ſerviceable to regulate this growth, and determine the parts which ſerve for its Nouriſhment, and by little and little to diſpoſe the Child like the Mother, or elſe like ſome of the ſame Species. This appears plain enough by the accidents which happen when the Imagination of the Mother is diſordered, and the Natural Diſpoſition of her Brain is changed by ſome violent paſſion, for then, as we have already explain'd, this communication charges
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60613:92"/>the conformation of the body of the Child, and the Mother is ſo much the more apt to miſcarry of the the <hi>Foetus,</hi> as it has more reſemblance to the deſired Fruits, and as the Spirits find leſs reſiſtance in the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the Infants body.</p>
                     <p>Now it cannot be deny'd, but that God, without this Communication, was able to have diſpoſed all things in ſo exact and regular a manner, as would have been neceſary for the Propagation of the Species for inſinite Ages, that Mothers ſhould never have Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and even that they ſhould always have had Children of the ſame bigneſs, of the ſame Colour, and that would have reſembled in all things: For we muſt not meaſure the power of God by our weak Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and we know not the Reaſons he had in the conſtruction of his work.</p>
                     <p>We ſee every day that without the help of this Communication, Plants and Trees produce their kinds regularly enough, and that Fowls and many other Animals have no need of it to cheriſh and bring forth other Animals, when they ſit upon Eggs of different kinds as when a Hen ſits on a Partridges Eggs. For although we may reaſonably conclude that the Seeds and Eggs contain in themſelves the Plants and Birds which proceeds from 'em; and that they may produce the little bodies of theſe Birds, having received their Conformation by the Communication we have ſpoke of, and the Plants theirs by another Equivocal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, yet we cannot be certain of it. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we cannot diſcover the reaſons why God has made every thing as it is, we muſt not conclude from thence, that he could make 'em no otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>If we conſider further, that Plants who receive their growth by the action of the Female Plant, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble her much more than thoſe which come from the ſeed, as Tuleps for inſtance, which come from the Root, are of the ſame Colour as the Tulep it ſelf, and yet thoſe that proceed from the Seed thereof, are almoſt very different, we cannot doubt, that if the Communication of the Female Plant with the Fruit, is not abſolutely neceſſary to form the ſame kind, yet it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60613:92"/>is always requiſite to make the Fruit intirely like her.</p>
                     <p>So that although God foreſaw that this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Mothers Brain with that of the Infants, would ſometimes deſtroy the <hi>Foetus,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Monſters, becauſe of the Irregularity of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers imagination; yet this Communication is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, and ſo neceſſary, for the Reaſons before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and for many others that I could yet add, that this knowledge, that God had of theſe inconvencies, ought not to have hindred him from executing his deſign. We may ſay in one ſenſe, that God never had a deſign to make Monſters, for it appears evident to me, that if God ſhould create one Animal only, it would not be Monſtrous. But deſigning to produce an admirable work by the moſt ſimple ways, and unite all theſe Creatures one to another, he foreſaw certain effects that would neceſſarily follow from the Order and Nature of things, and this hath not diverted him from his deſign: For, although a Monſter, ſimply conſidered, be an imperfect work, yet when it is joyn'd with the reſt of the creatures, it does not render the World imperfect.</p>
                     <p>We have ſufficiently explain'd what power the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of a Mother has over the body of her Child, let us now examine the power it hath over its Mind, and that way diſcover the firſt Irregularities of the Mind and Will of Men in his Original: For this is our chief deſign.</p>
                     <p>It is evident that the traces of the Brain are accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Sentiments and Ideas of the Soul,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>An Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of ſome irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities of the Mind, and of the inclinations of the Will.</hi>
                        </note> and that the emotion of the Animal Spirits have no effect in the Body, but what the Motions in the Soul anſwer to; and in a word, it is certain that all the Senſations and Paſſions of the Body are accompany'd with true Sentiments and Paſſions in the Soul. Now according to our firſt ſuppoſition, Mothers firſt communicate the traces of their Brain to their Children, and afterwards the Motions of their Animal Spirits, and ſo produce the ſame paſſion in the mind of their Children, with which they themſelves are affected, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60613:93"/>they cortupt both their affections and reaſon in ſeveral reſpects.</p>
                     <p>If ſo many Children are obſerved to bear upon their Faces the Marks and Traces of the Idea that affected their Mother, although the Fibres of the skin make much more reſiſtance againſt the courſe of the Spirits than the ſoft parts of the Brain, and thô the Spirits are much more agitated in the Brain than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Skin; we cannot reaſonably doubt but that the Animal Spirits of the Mother produce in the Brain of the Infant many traces by their irregular emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now the great traces of the Brain, and the emotion of the Spirits which anſwer to them, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing a long time, and ſometimes all the life; it is certain, that as there are few Women who have not ſome weakneſſes, and who have not been moved with ſome Paſſion during their being with Child, it cannot be expected but that there will be very few Children, who are not ill inclined to ſomething, and who have not ſome predominant paſſion.</p>
                     <p>We have only too much experience of theſe things, and all the World is ſenſible that there are whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies who are afflicted with great weakneſs of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which they have drawn from their Parents; but it is not neceſſary here to give any particular Examples thereof. On the contrary, 'tis more proper for the conſolation of ſome Perſons to aſſure 'em, that thoſe weakneſſes of the Parents not being Natural, or proper to the Nature of Man, the traces and impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Brain, which are the cauſe of them, may be effaced by time.</p>
                     <p>We may yet add here the Example of King <hi>James</hi> I. of <hi>England,</hi> of whom Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby</hi> ſpeaks in his Book which he writ of the <hi>Sympathetic Powder.</hi> He tells us, that <hi>Mary Stuart</hi> being with Child of King <hi>James,</hi> ſome Scotch Lords entred her Chamber, and in her preſence killed her Secretary, who was an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, altho' ſhe caſt her ſelf before him to hinder them, that this Princeſs received ſome ſlight hurts by them, and the frights ſhe had, made ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in her Imagination, that ſhe communicated it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60613:93"/>to the Child in her Womb: So that King <hi>James</hi> cou'd never endure to ſee a Naked Sword. He ſays that he himſelf was a witneſs of it, for when he was Knighted, this Prince coming to lay the Sword upon his Shoulder run it ſtrait at his Face, and had woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, if ſome body had not directed it aright where it ought to be. There are ſo many inſtances of the like Nature, that 'twould be needleſs to ſearch Authors for them. I believe there is no body that will diſpute theſe things; for we ſee a great number of Perſons that can't ſuffer the fight of a Rat, of a Mouſe, a Cat, a Frog, and particularly creeping Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, as Serpents, and Adders; who know no other cauſe of theſe extraordinary averſions, but the fear their Mothers had of theſe ſeveral Animals whilſt they were with Child of them.</p>
                     <p>But what I chiefly deſire ſhould be obſerved, is,
<note place="margin">An Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence and of Original Sin.</note> that there is all poſſible probabilities, that Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in their Brain to this day the traces and impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our firſt Parents. For as Animals produce their own likeneſs, and with the like traces in their Brain, which is the cauſe that Animals of the ſame Species, have the ſame Sympathies and Antipathies, and that they perform the ſame actions in the ſame occurrences. Thus our firſt Parents, after their Sin, received ſuch great impreſſions, and profound traces of ſenſible things in their Brain as they might very well communicate to their Children; ſo that this great propenſity we have from the Womb to all ſenſible things, and the great diſtance from God we are in, by our preſent ſtate, may in ſome manner be explained by what has been ſaid.</p>
                     <p>For as it is neceſſary, according to the eſtabliſhed order of Nature, that the thoughts of the Soul ſhould be conformable to the traces that are in the Brain. We may ſay, that as ſoon as we are formed in the Womb, we are polluted with Sin, and infected with the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our Parents, ſince from that time we are ſtrongly inclined to the pleaſures of our Senſes; having in our Brain traces reſembling thoſe of the Perſons who hath given us being, it is neceſſary alſo, that we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60613:94"/>ſhou'd have the ſame thoughts, and the ſame inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have any relation to ſenſible objects.

                     <p>Thus it is impoſſible but that we ſhould be born with Concupiſcence, and Original Sin. We muſt be born with Concupiſcence, if Concupiſcence is only the Natural effort that the traces of the Brain make upon the Mind to engage it to ſenſible things; and we muſt be born in Original Sin, if Original Sin is nothing elſe but the Dominion of Concupiſcence, and that theſe efforts become Victorious and Maſters over the Mind and Heart of the Child. Now it is very probable, that the dominion or victory of Concupiſcence, is what we call Original Sin in Children, and actual in Men.</p>

                        </label> This difficulty ſeems only to recur, that contrary to Experience we might conclude from the principles I have eſtabliſhed, that the Mother would always communicate to her Child Habits and Inclinations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling her own, and a facility of imagining and learning the ſame things as ſhe knows; for all theſe things depend, as has been already ſaid, only upon the traces and impreſſions of the Brain; and it is certain that the impreſſions and traces of the Mothers Brain are communicated to the Child. This has been proved by the Examples that has been brought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Men, and is alſo confirmed by the Example of Animals, whoſe young ones have their Brains filled with the ſame impreſſions, which is the reaſon that all thoſe that are of the ſame kind have the ſame Voice, the ſame manner of moving their Members, and alſo the ſame craft to take their Prey, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves from their Enemies: Therefore it muſt from thence follow, that ſince all the traces of the Mothers Brain are imprinted in that of the Childs, that the Children muſt be born with the ſame Habits, and all the other qualities that the Mothers are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of; and even commonly ſo to preſerve them all their Lives, ſince the Habits they have from their Infancy, are thoſe that are the longeſt kept; which nevertheleſs is contrary to experience.</p>
                     <p>To anſwer this Objection, it is requiſite it ſhould be known that there are two ſorts of traces in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60613:94"/>Brain; the one Natural, or proper to the Nature of Man, the other acquired. The Natural are very deep and it is impoſſible to eſface them perfectly, but on the contrary the acquired may be eaſily loſt, becauſe commonly they are not deep; Now although the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and acquired differ only as to the <hi>More</hi> or <hi>Leſs,</hi> and that often the firſt have leſs force than the ſecond, ſince we every day accuſtom Animals to do things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly contrary to what they are inclined by theſe Natural traces (for Example, we uſe a Dog not to touch Bread, nor to run after a Partridge, although he ſees and ſmells it.) Yet there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> this difference between theſe traces, that the Natural ones have, if we may ſo ſay, ſecret alliances with the other parts of the body; thus all the Springs of our Machines aſſiſt one the other to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their Natural ſtate. All the parts of our bodies mutually contribute to all neceſſary things for the preſervation, or re-eſtabliſhment of theſe Natural traces. Thus we cannot wholly efface them, and they begin to revive when we believe we have deſtroyed them.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, the acquired Traces, although greater, more profound, and ſtronger than the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are loſt by little and little, if they are not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved by a continual application of thoſe things that produced them, becauſe the other parts of the body contribute nothing to their preſervation, but on the contrary continually endeavour to efface and looſe them. We may compare theſe traces to the common Wounds of the body, they are wounds that our Brains receive which heal of themſelves, as theſe wounds of the body do, by the admirable conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Machine.</p>
                     <p>As then there is nothing in all the body which is not conformable to the Natural traces, they tranſmit themſelves into Children with all their force: So Parrots hatch little ones, which have the ſame or Natural voices with themſelves: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe acquired traces are only in the Brain, and not diſperſed through the reſt of the body, except
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60613:95"/>ſome few of 'em, as when they have been imprinted by the Motions that accompany violent Paſſions, they muſt not be tranſmitted into Children. Thus a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rot who gives the good Morrow, and good Night to his Maſter, will not make his little ones as Learned as himſelf; and ſo Wiſe and able Perſons will not have Children which reſemble them.</p>
                     <p>Thus although it be true, that all which paſſes in the Mothers Brain, paſſes alſo in the ſame time into that of the Child, and that the Mother can ſee nothing, feel nothing, imagine nothing, that the Child does not likewiſe ſee, feel, and imagine, and that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Yet when theſe traces are formed by a ſtrong paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and accompanied with a violent agitation of the Blood and Spirits in the Mother, they act with ſo much force on the Child's Brain, and on the reſt of its body, that they imprint there Traces as deep and laſting as Natural ones: As in the Example of Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> in the Child that became a Fool, and all broken in the Brain, and all the Members in which the Imagination of the Mother had produced ſuch great diſorders, and likewiſe in the example of the general corruption of Man's Fature.</p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:60613:95"/>
                     <p>Nor is it to be wondered, if the Children of King <hi>James</hi> had not the ſame weakneſs as their Father; Firſt, becauſe theſe ſort of Traces are never imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo far into the reſt of the Body as the Natural ones are: Secondly, becauſe the Mother not having the ſame weakneſs with the Father, ſhe hinder'd its hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening through the goodneſs of her Conſtitution, and becauſe the Mother acts inſinitely more upon the Brain than the Father does, as is evident by what has been already ſaid.</p>
                     <p>But it muſt be obſerved, that all theſe reaſons, which prove that the Children of King <hi>James</hi> cou'd not participate of the weakneſs of their Father, prove nothing againſt the Explanation of Original Sin, or this powerful Inclination for Senſible Things, nor this great diſtance from God, which we hold from our firſt Parents; becauſe the Traces, that ſenſible Objects have imprinted in the Brain of the firſt Man, were very deep, and were accompanied and augmented with violent Paſſions, and fortified by the continual uſe of ſenſible Things, and ſuch as were neceſſary to the preſervation of life, not only in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> but alſo, which muſt be well obſerved, in the greateſt Saints, in all Men and all Women from whom we deſcend, ſo that there is nothing which can put a ſtop to this corruption of Nature. So far are theſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our firſt Fathers, from being effaced by little and little, that, on the contrary, they are augmented daily, and without the Grace of <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST,</hi> which continually oppoſes this torrent, what this Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poet has ſaid, wou'd be abſolutely true.</p>

                     <p>For it muſt be well obſerved, that thoſe impreſſions that ſtir up Sentiments of Piety in the moſt Devout Mothers, do not communicare it to their unborn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; and that, on the contrary, the Traces which excite the Idea of ſenſible Things, and which are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60613:96"/>lowed with Paſſions, fail not to communicate to the Infants the Senſation and Love of Senſible Things.</p>
                     <p>A Mother, for Inſtance, who is excited to love God by the Motion of the Spirits, which accompany the Trace of the Image of a venerable Old Man, becauſe this Mother has united the Idea of God to this Trace of the Old Man; for, as we ſhall ſoon ſee in the Chapter of the connexion of Idea's, that it may eaſily be done, altho' there is no relation between God and the Image of an Old Man. This Mother, I ſay, can only produce in the Brain of her Child the Trace of an Old Man, and an inclination for Old Men, which is not the love of God wherewith ſhe was affected: For, indeed, there is no Traces in the Brain, which can of themſelves ſtir up any other Idea's than thoſe of Senſible Things, becauſe the Body is not made to Inſtruct the Mind, and ſpeaks not to the Soul as to it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>Thus a Mother, whoſe Brain is filled with Traces, which by their nature relate to ſenſible things, and which ſhe cannot efface, ſince concupiſcence ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in her, becauſe her Body is not brought under ſubjection, neceſſarily communicates them to her Child, and begets it a ſinner altho' ſhe be righteous. This Mother is righteous, becauſe actually loving, or having loved God by a love of choice, this concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence makes her no longer criminal, altho' ſhe ſhou'd follow the Motions thereof in her ſleep: But the Child ſhe begets not loving God by a love of choice, and its heart not being turned towards God, it is evident that it is ſubject to diſorder and irregularity, and that there is nothing in it which deſerves not the wrath of God.</p>
                     <p>But, when they are regenerated by Baptiſm, and have been juſtified either by a diſpoſition of heart, like to that which remains in righteous Perſons du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the illuſions of the Night, or it may be by a free act of love to God, as they have made, being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome moments, from the dominion of the Body through the power of this Sacrament; (for, as God hath made them to love him, we cannot conceive that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:60613:96"/>they are actually in the righteouſneſs and order of God, if they love him not, or have not loved him; or, at leaſt, if their heart is not diſpoſed after the ſame manner, as it wou'd be if they actually loved him) Then, altho' they ſubmit to concupiſcence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Infancy, their concupiſcence is no longer Sin; it makes them no longer guilty and worthy of wrath; they ceaſe not to be righteous and agreeable to God, by the ſame reaſon as we do not loſe Grace, altho' in our ſleep we ſhou'd follow the Motions of concupiſcence; for the Brain of Infants is ſo ſoft, and they receive ſo lively and ſtrong impreſſions of the weakeſt Objects, as they have not ſufficient freedom of Mind to reſiſt them. But I ſtay too long upon theſe things, which do not abſolutely belong to the ſubject I treat of. 'Tis enough, that I may conclude here from what I have explained in this Chapter, that all theſe falſe Traces,
<note place="margin">See the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> that Mothers imprint in the Brain of their Children, make their Minds falſe, and corrupt their Imagination; and that thus the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Men, are ſubject to imagine things other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than they are, in giving ſome falſe colour, or irregular draught to the Idea's of thoſe things they perceive.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the precedent Chapter, we have conſider'd the Brain of an Infant whileſt in the Womb; let us now examine what happens to it as ſoon as it is Born. In the ſame time that it quits Darkneſs, and firſt ſees Light, the cold of the outward Air ſeizes it; the tendereſt embraces of the Woman that receives it, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends its delicate Members; all external Objects ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it; they are all Subjects of fear to it, becauſe it does not yet know them, nor has it any power of it ſelf, to defend it ſelf, or to fly from them; the Tears and Cries by which it condoles it ſelf, are infallible marks of its pains and fears; for they are, indeed, the Prayers that Nature makes to procure it aſſiſtance, to defend it from the evils it ſuffers, and thoſe it apprehends.</p>
                     <p>To be able to conceive well the perplexity of its Mind in this condition, we muſt remember that the Fibres of its Brain are very ſoft and delicate; and by conſequence, all external Objects make very deep impreſſions upon them: For ſince the leaſt things are ſometimes capable of hurting a weak Imagination, ſo great a number of ſurprizing Objects muſt certainly injure and perplex that of a Child.</p>
                     <p>But to have a more lively apprehenſion of the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and pains of Infants, at the time of their firſt coming into the World, and the prejudices which their Imaginations muſt receive, let us repreſent to our ſelves what would be the aſtoniſhment of Men, if they ſaw Giants five or ſix times higher than themſelves ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach near them, without knowing any thing of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:60613:97"/>their deſign; or if they ſaw any new kind of Animal, which had no reſemblance to thoſe they have already ſeen; or only, if a Flying-Horſe, or ſome other Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera of our Poets, ſhou'd ſuddenly deſcend from the Clouds. Theſe Prodigies wou'd make deep Traces in the Spirits, and the Brain wou'd be confuted, only to have ſeen them once.</p>
                     <p>Unexpected and frightful events fall out every day, which makes even Men loſe their Wits, whoſe Brains are not very ſuſceptible of new impreſſions, altho', they have ſome Experience, and can defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or, at leaſt, are able to make uſe of ſome reſolution. Children, when firſt come into the World, ſuffer ſomething from every Object that ſtrikes their Senſes, to which they are not accuſtomed: All the Animals they ſee, are of a new kind to them, ſince they have ſeen nothing before like to them; they have neither ſtrength nor experience; the Fibres of their Brain are very delicate and flexible: How then is it poſſible, but that their Imagination ſhou'd be injured by ſo many different Objects?</p>
                     <p>It is true, that Mothers have already a little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed their Children to the impreſſions of Objects, ſince they have already traced them in the Fibres of their Brain, before they were born, and ſo they are much leſs hurt, when they ſee with their own Eyes what they had before in ſome manner perceived by thoſe of their Mothers. It is alſo true, that falſe Traces, and the injuries that their Imagination re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives at the ſight of ſo many frightful Objects, are effaced and cured by time; becauſe not being Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, all Bodies are contrary to them, and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate them, as we have ſeen in the precedent Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And this is the reaſon that generally all Men are not Fools from their Infancy, yet it does not hinder, but that there is always ſome Traces ſo ſtrong and deep, that cannot be effaced all our Lives</p>
                     <p>If Men wou'd but ſeriouſly reflect upon what paſſes within themſelves, and upon their own thoughts, they wou'd not want Experience to prove what I have
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60613:98"/>ſaid: They wou'd commonly diſcover in themſelves inclinations, and ſecret averſions, which others have not, for which there can be no other cauſe aſcribed than theſe Traces of our Infancy. For ſince the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of theſe inclinations and averſions are particular to us, they are not founded in the Nature of Man; and ſince they are unknown to us, it muſt be that they have acted in a time, wherein our Memory was not capable to retain the circumſtances of things, ſo as to make us able to remember them; and this time can only be that of our moſt tender Infancy.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>D'Cartes</hi> hath told us in one of his Letters, that he had a particular kindneſs for all ſquinting Perſons, and that in having carefully examined the cauſe of it, he at laſt found 'twas a defect he had met with in a young Maid whom he had loved, whileſt he was yet a Child, and the affection he had for her, made him love all perſons that reſembled her in any thing.</p>
                     <p>But it is not theſe little Irregularities of our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which moſtly deceive us; it proceeds from this, That all our Minds are weak in ſome reſpect or other, and we are all ſubject to ſome kind of Folly, altho' we are not ſenſible of it. When we carefully examine the Genius of thoſe with whom we converſe, we eaſily perſwade our ſelves of this, altho' we are our ſelves an Original of ſome particular Folly, and may be ſo accounted by others; yet we ſhall alſo find others that have Follies peculiar to themſelves, and who differ only as to the <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now one of the cauſes of the different Characters of Diſpoſitions, and without doubt, the difference of the impreſſions that we receive at our Birth, (as we have ſhown of the particular and extraordinary Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,) is, becauſe theſe kinds of folly being common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtant and durable, they can only depend upon the Conſtitution of the Animal Spirits, which very eaſily change; and by conſequence, it is neceſſary that they proceed from falſe Impreſſions, which are made in the Fibres of the Brain, when our Memory
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60613:98"/>was not capable of preſerving the Idea's thereof; that is, from the beginning of our Life. A general ſource of the Errors of Man, is the great diſorder of their Brain, cauſed by the impreſſion of external Objects when firſt they come into the World; but this cauſe ceaſes not ſo ſoon as may be imagined.</p>
                     <p>The common Converſation that Children are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have with their Nurſes, or even with their Mothers, who often have no Education, does preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and entirely corrupts their Diſpoſition; theſe Women entertain them only with ſilly things, as ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Stories, or ſuch as are only fit to fright them. They never ſpeak to them but of ſenſible things, and after ſuch a manner as is too ſure to confirm them in the falſe Judgments of their Senſes. And, in a word, they caſt into their Minds the Seeds of all the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes they themſelves have, as of their extravagant apprehenſions, ridiculous ſuperſtitions, and other the like prejudices; by which means, they neither being accuſtomed to ſearch after Truth, nor to have any guſt of it, they become at laſt incapable of diſcerning it, or of making any uſe of their reaſon; upon which account, a certain fearfulneſs and weakneſs of Spirit ſeizes them, which continues with them a long time; for there are many perſons, who at the Age of fifteen or twenty, that perfectly retain the Spirit of their Nurſe.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that Children don't appear very proper for the Meditation of Truth, and for abſtracted and elevated Sciences, becauſe the Fibres of their Brain, being very delicate, they are eaſily agitated, even by the weakeſt and leaſt ſenſible Objects; and their Soul neceſſarily having Senſations proportionated to the agitation of theſe Fibres, ſhe lets go her Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical Thoughts, and pure Intellections, to apply her ſelf only to her own Senſations. Thus, it ſeems, Children cannot conſider the pure Idea's of Truth with ſufficient attention, being ſo often and eaſily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed by the confuſed Idea's of their Senſes.</p>
                     <pb n="164" facs="tcp:60613:99"/>
                     <p>Yet we may anſwer, firſt, that it is more eaſie for a Child of ſeven years to be deliver'd from the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors whereinto the Senſes lead it, than for a perſon of Sixty, who has all his life time followed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of Infancy. Secondly, that if a Child is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the clear and diſtinct Idea's of Truth, it is at leaſt, capable of being advertiſed, that its Senſes deceive it upon every occaſion; and if we do not teach it the Truth, we ought not, at leaſt, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or fortify it in its Errors. And, laſtly, that the youngeſt Children, how wedded ſoever they may be to agreeable and painful Senſations, learn ſoon what grown Perſons can't do in much more time; as the Knowledge of the Order and Relations that there is between all Words, and all Things, which they ſee and hear: For altho' theſe Things depend chiefly on the Memory, yet it is plain enough, that they muſt make great uſe of their Reaſon in the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they learn their Tongue.</p>
                     <p>But ſince the facility that the Fibres of Childrens Brains have for the receiving the impreſſions of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Advice for the well Educating of Children.</hi>
                        </note> is the reaſon why they are incapable of Judging of abſtracted Sciences, it is very eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it. For 'tis certain, that if Children were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without fear, without deſires, and without hopes; if we did not make them ſuffer pain, and if we kept them as much as poſſible from their little pleaſures, we might, as ſoon as they cou'd ſpeak, teach them the moſt difficult, and moſt abſtracted, or, at leaſt, the moſt ſenſible parts of the Mathematics, Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics, and other things of the like Nature, which are neceſſary in the ſequel of life: But their Minds are not fit to be applied to abſtracted Sciences, when they are agitated by deſires, and troubled with frights, which is requiſite to be well conſidered.</p>
                     <p>For, as an ambitious Man, who ſhou'd loſe his Riches and Honour, or who ſhou'd have been raiſed, all of a ſudden, to a great Dignity, which he cou'd not have hoped for, wou'd not be in a condition to reſolve Metaphyſical Queſtions, or Algebraick Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60613:99"/>but only to do ſuch things as his preſent paſſion inſpired him with. So Children, in whoſe Brain an Apple, and Sugar-plumb, make as deep impreſſions, as Offices and Grandeurs do in that of a Man of Forty, are not in a condition of hearing ſuch abſtracted Truths as we teach them. So that it may be affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is nothing more contrary to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Children in the Sciences, than the continual Divertiſements wherewith they recompence them, and the continual Puniſhments they threaten them with.</p>
                     <p>But what is infinitely more conſiderable, is, that theſe fears of Chaſtiſement, and theſe deſires of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Recompence, with which they fill Childrens Minds, extreamly diverts them from Piety. Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is yet more abſtracted than Science, it is leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by corrupted Nature. The Mind of Man is very much inclined to Study, but it is not ſo to Piety. If, therefore, great agitations permit us not to ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, altho' we naturally have ſome pleaſure in it, how is it poſſible that Children, which are taken up with ſenſible Pleaſures wherewith they recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence them, and with the Pains they fright them with, ſhou'd preſerve a ſufficient freedom of Mind, to give them any inclination to Piety?</p>
                     <p>The capacity of the Mind is very much limited, many things are not requiſite to fill it, and when it is full, it is incapable of new Thoughts, except it emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it ſelf of ſome it had before: But when the Mind is filled with ſenſible things, it cannot part with them when it will; to conceive this, we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der we are all naturally inclined to Good, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure being the Character whereby we diſtinguiſh it from Evil, it is neceſſary that Pleaſures ſhou'd affect us, and employ us more than all the reſt. Pleaſure then being united to the uſe of ſenſible things, becauſe they are the Goods of Mans Body, there is a kind of neceſſity that theſe goods ſhou'd fill the capacity of our Minds, until God by imbittering them, gives us a diſtaſte and horror of them, and by his Grace,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60613:100"/>makes us feel the ſweetneſs of Heaven, which effaces all the Pleaſures of this World.

                     </p>
                     <p>But becauſe we are as much inclined to ſhun Evil as to love Good, and Pain is the Character that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has united to Evil, all that we have ſaid of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, muſt, in a contrary ſenſce, be underſtood of Pain.</p>
                     <p>Since thoſe things, therefore, that make us feel Pleaſure and Pain, fill the capacity of the Mind, and that it is not in our power to quit, or not to be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, when we pleaſe; it is plain, that we cannot make Children be inclined to Piety no more than Men, if we do not begin with them according to the Precepts of the Goſpel, by a privation of all things that touch the Senſes, and which excite great deſires and great fears, ſince all the Paſſions darken and extinguiſh Grace, and that inward love to our Duty, which God has implanted in us.</p>
                     <p>The leaſt Children have reaſon as well as Men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' they have not experience, they have alſo the ſame natural inclinations tho' they are carried to very different Objects; they muſt, therefore, be accuſtom'd to guide themſelves by reaſon, ſince they have it, and excited to their Duty by rightly managing their good Inclinations. It deſtroys their reaſon, and corrupts their beſt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to engage them to their Duty by ſenſible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. They appear then to be in their Duty, but 'tis only an appearance; Virtue is neither engraven in their Mind nor Heart; they ſcarcely know it, and they love it much leſs. Their Mind is full of fears and deſires, of averſions to, and love of ſenſible things, which they cannot diſingage themſelves from to gain their Liberty, and to make uſe of their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Thus Children, who are educated after this baſe and ſervile manner, accuſtom themſelves by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, to a certain inſenſibility of all the Sentiments of honeſt Men, and good Chriſtians, which continues with them all their Lives; and when they think themſelves freed from Chaſtiſements, either by their Authority or Craft, they abandon themſelves
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60613:100"/>to whatever flatters their Concupiſcence and their Senſes, becauſe, indeed, they know no other good than what is ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>It is true, there are ſome occurrences wherein it is neceſſary to inſtruct Children by their Senſes, but it muſt only be done when Reaſon is not ſufficient. They muſt firſt be perſwaded to their Duty by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and if they are not capable of acknowledging their obligations to it, it will be beſt to let them alone for ſome time; for to force them to do outwardly, what they did not believe their Duty, wou'd not be to inſtruct them, ſince 'tis the Mind muſt be taught and not the Body:

                     <p>If Chaſtiſements neither Inſtruct the Mind, nor incline us to love Virtue, yet at leaſt, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they correct the Body, and hinder it from reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Vice, and by conſequence, prevent it from being a ſlave to it. But what muſt chiefly be obſerved, is, that Puniſhments fill not the capacity of the Mind as Pleaſures do, for they are no ſooner at an end, and we free from the danger of ſuffering them again, but we are eaſily induced to forget them, becauſe then they neither ſolicit the Imagination, nor excite the Paſſions; nor provoke the Concupiſcence. In fine, they leave the Mind wholly at liberty to think on what it pleaſes, ſo that we may exerciſe it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Children, to keep them in their Duty, or, at leaſt, in the appearance of it.</p>
                     <p>But tho' it is ſometimes neceſſary to deter and puniſh Children by ſenſible Chaſtiſements, yet it muſt not from thence be concluded, that we ought to perſwade them by ſenſible rewards; we muſt never make uſe of any thing that very much affects the Senſes, but when the utmoſt neceſſity requires it: And there is no need of affecting them with ſenſible rewards, by repreſenting Pleaſures to them as the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60613:101"/>end of their Labours. For, on the contrary, it wou'd corrupt their beſt Actions, and rather incline them to Senſuality than Virtue.</p>
                     <p>The Impreſſions of thoſe Pleaſures we have once taſted, continue very ſtrongly to affect the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and often revive in us the Idea's of ſenſible Goods, always exciting importunate deſires which diſturb the peace of the Mind: And, in ſhort, they ſtir up the Concupiſcence upon every occaſion, and it is as Leaven that corrupts the whole lump. But this is not a proper place to explain theſe things as they ought to be.</p>

In This, we ſhall endeavour to make ſome Application of thoſe Cauſes, to the General Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Imagination, and we ſhall likewiſe Treat of the Cauſes of thoſe Errors, which may be term'd Moral.</p>
                     <p>It may be ſeen, by what has been ſaid in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, that the extream fineneſs of the Fibres of the Brain is one of the Principal Cauſes that hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from applying our ſelves with ſo much thought and ſtudy as we ought, to the Diſcovery of Truths that are but a little Myſterious.</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60613:102"/>Manners. In ſuch things as theſe their Knowledge, Capacity, and Acuteneſs ſurpaſſes that of Men. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever depends upon the Senſes is under their Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but uſually they are unable to dive into Truths, that are any thing difficult to be diſcover'd. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Abſtracted, to them is incomprehenſible. They cannot make uſe of their Imagination to unfold intangl'd and intricate Queſtions. They only conſider the outſide of things; nor has their Imagination either Strength or Extent enough to penetrate to the Bottom, or to Compare all the Parts without diſtracting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A Trifle puts them out of the way; the leaſt noiſe affrights 'em; the ſlighteſt Motion finds 'em work. In ſhort, the Manner and not the Reality of things, is ſufficient to fill the whole Capacity of their Mind; becauſe the ſmalleſt Objects producing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Motions in the Delicate Fibres of the Brain, raiſe in the Soul thoſe Sentiments which are active and large enough to poſſeſs it wholly.</p>
                     <p>If it be certain that this delicacie of the Fibres of the Brain is the Principal Cauſe of theſe Effects, 'tis not ſo ſure however that 'tis to be met with in all Women; but admit it be, their Animal Spirits have ſome times ſuch a proportion with the Fibres of their Brains, that there are ſome Women who have more Solidity of Judgment then ſome Men. For the ſtrength of Wit conſiſts in a certain Temperament of the groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Agitation of the Animal Spirits with the Fibres of the Brain; and Women ſometimes have this ſame juſt and Equal Conſtitution. There are ſome Women ſtrong and conſtant, others feeble and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. There are ſome Women Learned, Courageous, and Capable of every Thing. On the other ſide, there are ſome Men unactive and Effeminate, uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of underſtanding or doing any Thing. In ſhort, when we attribute any Defects to this or that Sex, to certain Ages, or ſuch and ſuch Conditions, we mean it with a proviſo, for the moſt part; ſuppoſing always, that there is no general Rule without an Exception.</p>
                     <p>For it is not to be imagin'd, that all Men, or all Women, of the ſame Age, Country, or Family, have
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60613:102"/>Brain of the ſame Conſtitution. 'Tis more proper to believe, that as we cannot meet with two Faces that reſemble each other in every Lineament, ſo we cannot meet with two Imaginations that are abſolutely alike; and that all Men, Women, and Children, differ one from another in the groſſer or more reſin'd delicacy of the Fibres of the Brain. For as we are not over haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſuppoſe an Eſſential <hi>Identity</hi> between Things, amongſt which we ſee no Difference, ſo neither are we to make Eſſential Differences, where we do not find a Perfect <hi>Identity;</hi> for theſe are the Errors into which we uſually fall.</p>
                     <p>That which is then to be ſaid concerning the Fibres of the Brain, is this, that they are very ſoft, and very ſmall in Children; that with Age they harden and get ſtrength; that nevertheleſs they are extreamly ſmall in the generality of Women, and in ſome Men, all their Life-time. There is nothing more to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd. And this may ſuffice to be ſaid of Women and Children, that as they make it not their Buſineſs to ſearch after Truth and inſtruct others, ſo their Errors are not very prejudicial; for they are ſeldom believ'd in thoſe things which they advance. Let us therefore ſpeak of Men full grown; whoſe Wit is in its full ſtrength and vigor; and who may be thought capable to ſind out the Truth and teach it to Others.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The uſual time that the Mind and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Man are in their greateſt perfection,

The Pleaſures and Pains of the Senſes for the moſt part make no farther Impreſſion upon 'em; ſo that they need no more then to defend themſelves from violent Paſſions, which rarely happen, and this they may do, provided they carefully avoid all occaſions that excite 'em; ſo that the Soul being no longer diſtracted with ſuch kind of Interruptions, may with more eaſe apply it ſelf to the Contemplation of Truth.</p>

But 'tis not of ſuch a Man that we are now to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; 'tis of the common ſort of Men, who for the moſt part are of another Conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>The Conſiſtence then, which we meet with at the years of Diſcretion in the Fibres of Mens Brains, is the cauſe, if it may be ſo ſaid, of the Solidity and Conſiſtence of their Errors: 'Tis the Seal that Seals their Prejudices, and all their falſe Opinions, and ſhelters 'em from the ſtrength of Reaſon. In a word, the more Advantageous this Conſtitution of the Fibres of the Brain is to Perſons well Educated, the more Diſadvantageous it is to the greateſt part of Men, ſince it confirms both the one and the other in their Preſent Thoughts and Opinions.</p>
                     <p>But Men are not only confirm'd in their Errors, when they are arriv'd at the Age of Forty or Fifty years; they are alſo more ſubject to fall into new ones; becauſe, that believing themſelves at that time able to judge of every thing, as indeed it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come 'em to be ſo, they decide with preſumption, and only conſult their own Prepoſſeſſions; for Men never argue upon things, but in ſome relation to thoſe Idea's which are moſt familiar to 'em. When a Chymiſt would Argue about ſome Natural Body, preſently his Three Principles come into his Mind. A Peripatic immediately thinks of the four Elements, and the four firſt Qualities; another Philoſopher refers every thing to other Principles. So that nothing can enter into the Mind of Man, which is not immediately infected with the Errors to which it is ſubject, or which does not augment the number of its Errors.</p>
                     <p>This Conſiſtence of the Fibres of the Brain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces another very bad Effect, eſpecially in Perſons more advanced in years, which is, to make 'em un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Meditation: They cannot ſet themſelves to the Conſideration of thoſe Things which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:60613:105"/>to know; and ſo they can never penetrate into thoſe Truths which are but a little conceal'd. They cannot reliſh the moſt Rational Sentiments, when they are ſupported by Principles which appear new to them; though they are otherwiſe very intelligent in things of which their years have given 'em great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. But all that I have here ſaid extends no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than only to ſuch as have ſpent their Youth without making uſe of their Wit or applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Study.</p>
                     <p>To clear theſe things, 'tis requiſite to know, that we cannot learn any thing whatever it be, without giving our minds to it, and that we cannot be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive upon any thing, if we do not imagine, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a lively repreſentation of it into the Brains. Now, that we may imagine Objects, 'tis neceſſary that ſome ſome part of the Brain give way, or that there ſhould be imprinted on it ſome other Motion, that ſo it may be able to form the Traces which are affix'd to the Idea's that repreſent thoſe Objects to us; ſo that if the Fibres of the Brain are but a little harden'd, they will admit no Inclinations or Motions, but what they were formerly accuſtom'd to. Whence it comes to paſs, that the Soul can never imagin, nor conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently be attentive upon what it deſires, but only upon things that are familiar to it.</p>
                     <p>From hence we muſt conclude, that it is of great advantage for a Man to Exerciſe himſelf in me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon all ſorts of Subjects, that ſo he may be able to acquire a Readineſs to think upon what he pleaſes. For as we acquire an extraordinary facility to ſtir our Fingers after various manners, and with a ſwiftneſs even to wonder, by frequent uſe in playing upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments; ſo the Parts of the Brain, the Motion o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> which is requiſite to imagine what we deſire, do by uſe and cuſtom acquire a certain eaſineſs and ſlexibility; which is the reaſon that Things are imagin'd more eaſily, more readily, and more diſtinctly.</p>
                     <p>Now the beſt way to acquire this Habitude, which makes the chief diſtinction betwixt a Wiſe Man and another Perſon, is to accuſtom our ſelves in our youth
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60613:106"/>to ſearch after the truth of ſuch things as are very difficult, becauſe at that Age the Fibres are more pliable and apt to give way.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs I do not pretend that this Facility is to be acquir'd by thoſe who are call'd Men of Study, yet make it their buſineſs only to read without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, and without ſearching of themſelves, the Deciſion of a Queſtion before they read it in an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: For 'tis viſible, that by that means only a Man acquires a facility to remember things that he has read. 'Tis every day obſervable, that they who read much, can never apply their Minds to new things that are told 'em, and that the vanity of their Learning hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying 'em to judge of thoſe things before they have conceiv'd 'em in their Minds, throws 'em into thoſe Errors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which other Men avoid.</p>
                     <p>But though the want of Application be the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe of their Errors, there is one that is peculiar to 'em. That in regard they always carry in their Memories an infinite number of confus'd Species, they preſently chooſe out ſome one which they look upon to be the Subject of the Diſpute, and becauſe the Things that are told 'em do not agree therewith, they judge ridiculouſly that their Opponent is deceiv'd. If you make it out to 'em, that they themſelves are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and that they do not ſo much as underſtand the State of the Queſtion, then they are mad, and not able to apprehend what is ſaid to 'em, and they ſtill keep ſtedfaſt to the firſt falſe Species which their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory preſented to 'em. If you ſhew 'em their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake too apparently, they will ſtart a Second and a Third, which they will defend ſometimes againſt all Appearance of Truth; nay, even againſt their own Conſciences; becauſe they have no reſpect or love for Truth, and becauſe they are aſham'd to acknowledge, that there are ſome things which others know better than themſelves.</p>
                     <p>What ever has been ſaid concerning Perſons of Forty or Fifty years of Age,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Of Old Men.</hi>
                        </note> with more Reaſon ought to be underſtood of Old Men, becauſe the Fibres of their Brain are ſtill more inflexible, and that for want
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60613:106"/>of Animal Spirits to trace out new Footſteps, their Imagination becomes altogether languiſhing. And becauſe the Fibres of their Brain are uſually inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with many ſuperfluous Humours, therefore they looſe by little and little the memory of things paſt, and fall into Infirmities that are common to Children. So that in their decrepit Age they have thoſe Defects which depend upon the Conſtitution of the Fibres of the Brain, which are to be met with both in Children and grown Men; though it may be ſaid that they are Wiſer than either, becauſe they are no longer ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to their Paſſions, which proceed from the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Agitation of the Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not undertake any farther Explanation of theſe things, becauſe it is eaſie to make a judgment of this Age, by the others that we have ſpoken of before, and to conclude from thence, that Old Men with much more difficulty conceive what is ſaid to 'em, than thoſe that are younger, that they are more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately tied to their Prejudices and long receiv'd Opinions, and conſequently that they are more har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd and confirm'd in their Errors and Ill Habits. Though this ought to be obſerved, that the State of Old Age does not happen preciſely at Sixty or Seventy years; that all Old Men do not doat; nor are all thoſe, who are paſt Sixty, always free from the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of young People, and that we ſhould proceed too far to draw General Conſequences from Eſtabliſh'd Principles.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I Suppoſe I have ſufficiently explain'd in the foregoing Chapters the various alterations that are to be met with in the Animal Spirits, and in the Conſtitution of the Fibres of the Brain, according to the ſeveral Ages of Man. So that but a little Meditation upon what has been ſaid, will help us to a diſtinct Knowledge of the Imagination, and of the moſt common Natural Cauſes of the Differences that are to be obſerv'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Wits, ſince all the Alterations that befall the Imagination and the Mind, are but Conſequences of thoſe in the Animal Spirits, and in the Fibres of which the Brain is compos'd.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſeveral Particular <hi>Moral</hi> Cauſes of the Alterations that befall the Imagination of Man, <hi>viz.</hi> their different Conditions, Employments, and manner of Living; to the Conſideration of which we muſt oblige our ſelves, ſince theſe ſorts of Alterations are the Cauſes of almoſt an infinite number of Errors, every one judging of Things according to the relation they have to his Condition. We do not think it neceſſary to ſpend time in Explaining the Effects of ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Cauſes, as great Sickneſſes, ſurpriſing Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and other unexpected Accidents, which make moſt violent impreſſions upon the Brain, and extreamly diſturb it, becauſe theſe things but rarely happen; and for that the Errors, into which ſuch ſort of Perſons fall, are ſo palpable, that they are no way contageous, ſeeing they are ſo eaſily found out and rejected by all the World.</p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:60613:107"/>
                     <p>Now for the more perfect apprehending all the Alterations, which Different Conditions produce in the Imagination, 'tis abſolutely neceſſary to remember that we never imagine Objects but by firſt forming Images of 'em; and that theſe Images are nothing elſe, but the Traces which the Animal Spirits delineate in the Brain, that we imagine things ſo much the more ſtrongly, the deeper and more plainly theſe Traces are impreſs'd, and the oftner and more violently the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits have paſt through them; and that when the Spirits have paſt through ſeveral times, they enter in more eaſily than into other parts adjoining, through which they never paſt, or at leaſt not ſo often. This is the moſt uſual Cauſe of the Confuſion and Falſhood of our Idea's. For the Animal Spirits, that are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Action of External Objects, or elſe by the Orders of the Soul, to produce certain Traces in the Brain, many times produce others, which in truth reſemble 'em in ſomething; but which are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Traces of the ſame Objects, nor thoſe which the Soul deſired to repreſent to it ſelf; for that the Animal Spirits finding ſome Reſiſtance in thoſe parts of the Brain, through which they ought to have paſt, readily turn aſide and croud into the deeper Traces of thoſe Idea's which are more familiar to us. And here we ſhall produce very manifeſt and ſenſible Examples of theſe Things.</p>
                     <p>When they who are not extreamly ſhort ſighted, behold the Moon, they ſee two Eyes, a Noſe, and a Mouth; in a word, it ſeems to them as if they ſaw a Face: Nevertheleſs there is nothing at all in the Moon of what they imagine there. Many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons behold there quite another Thing. And they, who take the Moon to be ſuch as ſhe ſeems to be to them, may be eaſily undeceived, if they look upon her with a ſmall Proſpective Glaſs; or if they conſult the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions which <hi>Hevelius, Riccioli,</hi> and others have publiſh'd. Now the Reaſon why Men generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Face in the Moon, and not the Irregular Spots which are there, is this, becauſe the Traces of the Face, which are in the Brain are very deep, for that we
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60613:108"/>frequently and with great Attention look upon Faces. So that the Animal Spirits finding ſome Reſiſtance in other parts of the Brain, eaſily turn aſide from the Direction which the Light of the Moon imprints, and enter into thoſe Traces to which the Idea's of a Face are naturally affixt. Beſides, that the Appearing Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Moon, not being much different from the largeneſs of an ordinary Head at a certain diſtance, the Impreſſion of it forms thoſe Traces which have a great Affinity with thoſe that repreſent a Noſe, a Mouth, and Eyes; and by that means determines the Spirits to take their Courſe in the Traces of a Face, Some there are who ſee a Man a Horſeback in the Moon, or any thing elſe, which is not a Face; becauſe their Imagination having been ſtrongly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by certain Objects, the ſame Traces are open'd by the leaſt things to which they have any Relation.</p>
                     <p>For the ſame Reaſon it is, that we imagine we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold Chariots, Men, Lions, and other Animals in the Clouds, when there is the leaſt reſemblance between thoſe Creatures and their Figures; and that all Men, but chiefly they who are accuſtomed to Deſigning and Drawing, many times ſee Heads of Men upon the Walls, where there are ſeveral Irregular Spots.</p>
                     <p>'Tis for this Reaſon alſo, that the Spirits of Wine, entring without any direction of the Will into Traces moſt familiar to us, help to diſcover Secrets of the greateſt Importance; and that in our ſleep we moſt commonly dream of thoſe Objects which we have ſeen in the day time, and which had form'd the largeſt Traces in the Brain; for that the Soul always repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to her ſelf thoſe things of which ſhe has the largeſt and deepeſt Traces. To theſe we may add other Examples more Compos'd.</p>
                     <p>A Diſtemper is a Novelty, it makes ſuch Havock as ſurprizes the World. This imprints ſuch deep Traces in the Brain, that the Diſtemper is always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Mind. Suppoſe this Diſeaſe, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, be call'd the Scurvy, all Diſtempers will be the Scurvy. The Scurvy is new, therefore all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers ſhall be the Scurvy. The Scurvy is attended
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60613:108"/>with ſeveral Symptoms, many of which are common to other Diſeaſes. That's nothing to the purpoſe; if it happen that the Sick Perſon has any one of thoſe Symptoms, he ſhall be ſick of the Scurvy, and they ſhall not ſo much as think of other Diſtempers that are accompanied with the ſame Symptoms; they will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that all the Accidents that they have known Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic Perſons labour under, befal them alſo. They ſhall preſcribe the ſame Remedies, and ſhall wonder why they do not work the ſame Effects, as they have wrought in others.</p>
                     <p>An Author applies himſelf to one ſort of Study; upon which the Traces of the Subject of his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make ſo deep an Impreſſion, and irradiate ſo vigorouſly over all the Brain, that many times they confound and deface the Traces of ſuch things as are very different one from another. There was one, for Example, who compil'd ſeveral Volumes upon the Croſs; this made him ſee Croſſes where ever he came: Nor was it without reaſon, that Father <hi>Morin</hi> derides him for believing that a Medal repreſented a Croſs, when it repreſented quite another thing. And by Vertue of ſuch a ſort of Imagination as this it was, that <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and ſeveral others, after they had ſtudy'd the Loadſtone, and admir'd its Properties, would needs apply, to <hi>Magnetick</hi> Qualities, a great Number of Natural Effects, which have not the leaſt Correſpondence with them.</p>
                     <p>The Examples here cited, are ſufficient to prove, that (from this extraordinary eaſineſs of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to repreſent to it ſelf the Objects which are moſt familiar to it, and the difficulty which it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes to imagine thoſe which are new and unuſual,) it come to paſs, that Men are always forming Idea's, which may be call'd Mix'd and Impure, and that the Mind never Judges of things, but with reference to it ſelf, and its firſt Thoughts. Thus the different Paſſions of Men, their Inclinations, their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, their Employments, their Qualities, their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; in a word, all their various Manners of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, producing very great differences in their
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60613:109"/>Idea's: And this it is, that makes them fall into an Infinite number of Errors, of which we ſhall diſcourſe more at large hereafter. This was it that made the Lord Chancellor <hi>Bacon</hi> utter theſe Judicious Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: <hi>All Perceptions, as well of the Senſe as of the Mind, are, Ex analogia Hominis, not ex analogia <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſi, eſtque intellectus humanus inſtar ſpeculi inequalis ad radios rerum, qui ſuam naturam naturae rerum immiſcet, cam<expan>

                           <hi>Of the Mutual Connexion between the Idea's of the Mind, and the Traces of the Brain; and of the Mutual Connexion between Traces and Traces, and between Idea's and Idea's.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AMong all Material Things, there is none more worthy the ſerious Study of Men, than the Structure of their Bodies, and the Correſpondence between all the Parts that Compoſe it; and of all Spiritual Things, there is none of which the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is more Neceſſary than that of the Soul, and how it is Related indiſpenſably to God, and naturally to the Body.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not ſufficient to perceive, or know confuſedly, that the Traces of the Brain are united one to another, and that they are attended by the Motion of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits; that the Traces being ſtirred up in the Brain, likewiſe ſtir up the Idea's in the Mind, and that the Motions excited in the Animal Spirits, excite the Paſſions in the Will. 'Tis requiſite therefore, as much as may be, to underſtand diſtinctly the cauſe of all thoſe different Unions, and chiefly the Effects which they are capable of producing.</p>
                     <p>We muſt underſtand the cauſe of them, to the end we may attain to the Knowledge of Him who is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60613:109"/>able to act within us, and to make us Happy or Miſerable; and it becomes us to underſtand the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, becauſe we ſhould know our ſelves as much as in us lyes, and other Men, with whom we Converſe: For then, we ſhall underſtand the ways and means of Conducting, Governing, and Preſerving our ſelves, in the moſt Happy and Perfect condition, to which it is poſſible for us to attain, according to the Order of Nature, and the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Goſpel; and we ſhall be able to live with other Men, when we know how to make uſe of them in our Neceſſities, and aſſiſt them in their Miſeries.</p>
                     <p>I do not pretend to explain in this Chapter, a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſo vaſt and ſo large an Extent: Nor do I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it altogether in the whole Work. There are many things of which I am Ignorant as yet, and which I never hope to underſtand exactly; there are other things which I believe I know, but which I cannot for all that Explain: For there is no Wit, how mean ſoever it be, that by Meditation cannot diſcover more Truths, than the moſt Eloquent Man in the World can relate.</p>
                     <p>I. We are not to imagine,
<note place="margin">Of the Union of the Soul with the Body.</note> as the greateſt part of Philoſophers do, that the Soul becomes Corporeal, when it is united with the Body, and that the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Spirit when it is united with the Soul. The Soul is not diffus'd into all the Parts of the Body, to give it Life and Motion, as the Imagination fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies; nor does the Body become capable of Senſation by its union with the Soul, as our deluding Senſes would ſeem to convince us. Every Subſtance remains what it is, and as the Soul is not capable of Extenſion and Motion, neither is the Body capable of Senſation and Inclinations. All the Alliance of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Soul, which is known to us, conſiſts in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Mutual correſpondence of the Thoughts of the Soul, with the Traces or Phantoms of the Brain, and the Emotions of the Soul with the Motions of the Spirits.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Soul receives ſome new <hi>Idea's,</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prints new Traces in the Brain; and ſo ſoon as the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:60613:110"/>Objects produce new Traces, the Soul receives new Idea's: Not that it conſiders thoſe Traces, for it has no knowledge of them; nor that thoſe Traces include thoſe Idea's, becauſe they have no Relation one with another: Nor, laſtly, that the Soul receives her Idea's from thoſe Traces; for, as we ſhall ſhow in another place, it is not to be conceiv'd that the Soul can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing from the Body, or that it becomes more Knowing, or more Enlightned, by adverting to it, as the Philoſophers pretend, who would have it, that the Soul ſhould perceive all Things, <hi>per converſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ad Phantaſmata,</hi> by Converſion to the Phantaſmes, or Traces of the Brain.</p>
                     <p>So ſoon as the Soul would have the Arm to move, the Arm is moved, tho' it does not ſo much as know what it ought to do to make it move; and ſo ſoon as the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits are agitated, the Soul finds it ſelf mov'd, tho' it does not ſo much as know there are Animal Spirits in the Body.</p>
                     <p>When I come to treat of the Paſſions, I ſhall ſpeak of the Connexion between the Traces of the Brain, and the Motions of the Spirits, and of that between the Idea's and Emotions of the Soul, for that all the Paſſions depend upon it. My buſineſs here, is only to treat of the affinity between Idea's and Traces, and the Connexion of the Traces one with another.</p>
                     <p>There are three very conſiderable Cauſes of the Connexion of the Idea's with the Traces;
<note place="margin">Three conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Idea's and Traces.</note> the firſt, and moſt general, is the <hi>Identity</hi> of Time. For fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it ſuffices, that we had certain Thoughts, at ſuch time as ſome new Traces came into our Brain, ſo that thoſe Traces cannot be produced again, without renewing the ſame Thoughts. If the Idea of God preſent it ſelf to my Mind, at the ſame time that my Brain was ſtruck with the ſight of theſe three Characters, <hi>Iah,</hi> or with the ſound of the Word it ſelf, 'tis enough if the Traces, which thoſe Characters have produc'd, be excited to make me think of God. And I cannot think of God, but there will be produc'd in my Brain ſome confuſed Traces of the Characters, or Sounds, which accompany'd the Thought, which I
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60613:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>had of God; for the Brain, being never without Phantaſmes, there are always ſuch, as have ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to what we think, tho' many times theſe Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſmes are very imperfect, and very confus'd.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Cauſe of the Connexion of the Idea's with the Traces, and which always ſuppoſes the firſt, is the Will of Man: This Will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> neceſſary, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Idea's, with the Traces, may be regulated and proper for Uſe. For if Men had not Naturally an Inclination, to agree between themſelves, to affix their Idea's to Senſible Signs, not only this Connexion of Idea's wou'd be abſolutely unprofitable for Society, but it would be alſo very Irregular and Imperfect.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, becauſe Idea's are never ſtrongly united with the Traces, but when the Spirits being agitated, they render thoſe Traces deep and durable. So that the Spirits being never agitated but by the Paſſions, if Men had no ſuch Union to communicate their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and participate of thoſe of others, 'tis evident that the exact Union of their Idea's with certain Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would be very weak, becauſe they do not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject themſelves to thoſe Exact and Regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, but to render themſelves Intelligible.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Repetition of the Meeting of the ſame Idea's, with the ſame Traces, being neceſſary to form a Connexion, that may be of long continuance, ſince the meeting, unleſs it be accompany'd with a violent Motion of the Animal Spirits, ſuffices not to make ſtrong Connexions; 'tis clear, that if Men ſhould refuſe to aſſent, it would be the greateſt Chance in the World, if the ſame Traces, and Idea's, ſhould meet together; ſo that the Will of Man is neceſſary to regulate the Connexion of the ſame Idea's with the ſame Traces, tho' this Will of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be not ſo much an effect of their Choice and Reaſon, as an Impreſſion of the Author of Nature, who has made us altogether one for another, and with a ſtrong Inclination to unite in Mind, as well as in Body.</p>
                     <p>The third Cauſe of the Connexion of the Idea's with the Traces, is the Conſtant and Immutable Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Will of the Creator. For example; There is
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60613:111"/>a Natural Connexion, and which depends not upon our Will; between the Traces produc'd by a Tree or Mountain, which we behold, and the Idea's of a Tree or Mountain; between the Traces which the Cries of a Man or Beaſt, that ſuffer Pain, beget in our Brain, the Air of one who threatens us, or of whom we ſtand in fear, and the Idea's of Grief, of Strength, or Weakneſs; as alſo between the Sentiments of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, of Fear, and Courage, which are excitedin us.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Natural Bands are the ſtrongeſt of all; they are generally alike in all Men, and they are abſolutely neceſſary for the Preſervation of Life: For which reaſon it is that they depend not upon our Will; for if the Band or Connexion of Idea's, with certain Sounds and Characters, be but feeble, and very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, in ſeveral Countries, 'tis becauſe it depends upon the weak and changeable Will of Men. And the reaſon why it depends upon it, is, becauſe this Connexion is not abſolutely neceſſary for Life, but only for living like Men that are to form, among themſelves, a Rational Society.</p>
                     <p>Here we muſt obſerve, that the Connexion of Idea's that repreſent to us Spiritual Things, and ſuch as are diſtinct from us, with the Traces of our Brain, is not, nor can be Natural; and by conſequence, it is, or may be different in all Men, for that it has no other Cauſe than their Will, and the Identity of Time, of which I have ſpoken before. On the other ſide, the Connexion of the Idea's of all Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Things, with certain particular Traces, is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and hence there are certain Traces that ſtir up the ſame Idea in all Men. For Example, there is no queſtion but that all Men have the Idea of a Square, upon the ſight of a Square, becauſe that Connexion is Natural, but 'tis to be doubted whither all Men have that Idea, when they hear the Word <hi>Square</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, becauſe that Connexion is entirely voluntary. The ſame thing may alſo be thought of all Traces, that are tyed to the Idea's of Spiritual Things.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe the Traces, which have a Natural Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Idea's, do affect the Mind, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60613:111"/>render it attentive, the greateſt part of Men do eaſily enough comprehend and retain Senſible Truths; that is, the mutual Relations that are between Bodies. On the other ſide, becauſe the Traces that have no other Connexion with the Idea's then what is voluntary, do never vigorouſly ſtrike the Mind, 'tis not without a great deal of trouble that all Men Comprehend, and with much more difficulty retain abſtracted Truths; that is, the mutual Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween things that fall not under the Imagination. But when theſe Relations are never ſo little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, they appear abſolutely Incomprehenſible, eſpecially to thoſe that are not accuſtomed to them, in regard they have not fortify'd the Connexion of thoſe abſtracted Idea's with their Traces, by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Meditation; and tho' others have perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended them, they forget them in a ſhort time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Connexion is ſeldom or never ſo ſtrong as the Natural one.</p>
                     <p>It is ſo true, that all the trouble Men have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and retain Spiritual and Abſtracted Things, proceeds from the difficulty of fortifying the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of their Idea's with the Traces of their Brain, that when they find a way to explain the Analogies of Spiritual Things, by the Relations of Material Things, they are eaſily apprehended, and imprinted after ſuch a manner in the Mind, that we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrongly convinced of them, but they are alſo much more eaſily retain'd. The General Idea which we have given of the Mind, in the firſt Chapter of this Work, is, perhaps, a ſufficient Proof of this.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, when the Relation between Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial things are expreſs'd in ſuch a manner, that there is no Connexion requir'd between the Idea's of the Things, and the Traces of their Expreſſions, 'tis a difficult matter to apprehend them, and they are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgot.</p>
                     <p>For Example: They, who begin the Study of <hi>Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra,</hi> or the Analytic Art, cannot but with great difficulty apprehend the Algebraic Demonſtrations; and when they have once underſtood them, they never remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60613:112"/>them long, becauſe the Squares, for Example, the Parallelograms, Cubes, Solids, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by <hi>aa, a3, abc,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe Traces have no Natural Connexion with their Idea's, the Mind is not able to ſix the Idea's of them, and examme their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
                     <p>But they who begin plain Geometry, do preſently, and clearly, conceive the Demonſtrations that are explain'd to them, provided they diſtinctly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Terms that are made uſe of, becauſe the Idea's of a Square, a Circle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Naturally ty'd to Traces of the Figures which they ſee before their Eyes. It alſo frequently happens, that the Expoſition of the Figure alone, which ſerves for the Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cauſes them ſooner to apprehend it than the Diſcourſes that explain it, becauſe the Words not being united to the Idea's, but by an Arbitrary Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, they do not excite thoſe Idea's with ſufficient quickneſs and clearneſs, to afford a ready apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Relations; for this is the principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why it is ſo hard a matter to underſtand the Sciences.</p>
                     <p>It may be obſerv'd by the By, and from what has been already ſaid, that thoſe Writers who Coyn a great many new Words, and new Figures, to explain their Sentiments, many times ſpend their time to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no benefit; they think to render themſelves In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, when indeed they make themſelves Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible. We define all our Terms, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, ſay they, and others ought to agree to them. 'Tis true, others agree to them in their Will, but their Nature is repugnant thereto. Their Idea's are not joyn'd to thoſe new Terms, becauſe there is requir'd both Uſe and great Practice for that. The Authors, perhaps, have been accuſtom'd to that Practice, but the Readers have not. When a Man goes about to Inſtruct the Mind, 'tis requiſite to underſtand it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ought to follow Nature, and not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke or hurt it.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, we ought not to condemn the Care that Mathematicians take in defining their Terms,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:60613:112"/>for 'tis evident they ought to define them, to prevent the trouble of Equivocal Words. But, as much as may be, they ought to make uſe of Terms that are received, or whoſe ſignification is not very remote from that which they go about to introduce; and this is that which Mathematicians do not always obſerve.</p>
                     <p>Nor do we pretend, by what we have ſaid, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn <hi>Algebra;</hi> more eſpecially, that which M. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcartes</hi> has re-eſtabliſh'd. For tho' the Novelty of a few Expreſſions, in that Science, gives the Mind ſome little trouble at firſt, yet there is ſo little variety and confuſion in the Expreſſions; and the Aſſiſtance, which the Mind receives by them, ſo far ſurpaſſes the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty it meets with, that we can hardly think it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to find a better way of expreſſing his Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or which better ſuits with the Nature of the Mind, ſo as to carry it farther into the Diſcovery of unknown Truths. The terms of that Science have no ſhare at all in the Capacity of the Mind, they do not burthen the Memory; they wonderfully abridge all our Idea's and Reaſonings, and render them in ſome meaſure ſenſible by Practice. In ſhort, their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit is much greater than that of Expreſſions, tho' Natural, or of Figures deſign'd by Triangles, Squares, and the like, which cannot be ſerviceable to the ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, and unfolding Truths, which are but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Myſterious. But let this ſuffice, for the connexion of Idea's with the Traces of the Brain. 'Tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry now to ſay ſomething of the connexion of the Traces one with another, and by conſequence, of that agreement which is between the Idea's that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Traces.</p>
                     <p>This connexion conſiſts in this,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Of the mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of the Trac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> that the Traces of the Brain are ſo well united together, that they can no longer be excited, but all thoſe that were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed at the ſame time will be alſo excited. For Example, when a Man happens to be at ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ceremony, if he obſerves all the circumſtances of it, and all the principal Perſons that were preſent, the Time, the Place, the Day, and all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:60613:113"/>'twill be enough that he remembers the Day, or ſome other circumſtance of the Ceremony leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to repreſent to himſelf all the reſt. For this reaſon it is, that when we cannot call to mind the principal Name of a Thing, we ſufficiently deſign it by making uſe of the Name, that ſignifies ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of that Thing. As when we cannot call to mind the proper Name of a Church, we may make uſe of another Name, which ſignifies a Thing that has ſome Relation to it. We may ſay, 'tis that Church where there was ſuch a Croud, where Mr.—Preaches, or whither we went laſt <hi>Sunday.</hi> And not being able to remember the proper Name of a Perſon, or it being more convenient to deſign it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another manner, we may denote it by ſaying, ſuch a one that has a Face pitted with the Small-Pox, ſuch a tall Man well Proportioned, or a little Crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back'd Man, according to the Inclinations we have for the Man, tho' he is to blame that makes uſe of Scornful Expreſſions.</p>
                     <p>Now the Mutual Connexion of the Traces, and conſequently, of the Idea's one with another, is not only the foundation of all the Figures of Rhetorick, but of an infinite number of other things of greater Impertance, as in Morality, Politicks, and generally in all Sciences, which have any Relation to Man, and by conſequence, of many things which we ſhall treat of in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>The cauſe of this Connexion of ſeveral Traces, is the <hi>Identity</hi> of Time, when they were imprinted in the Brain; for 'tis ſufficient, that ſeveral Traces were produc'd at the ſame time, to renew them altogether: For the Animal Spirits, finding the way of all the Traces open, that are made at the ſame time, they continue their way, becauſe they paſs more eaſily through it than other parts of the Brain. This is the cauſe of Memory, and of the Corporeal Habits which are common to us with Beaſts.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Connexions of the Traces, are not always accompanied with the Emotions of the Spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all things which we ſee, do not appear to us
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60613:113"/>always either Good or Evil. Theſe Connexions alſo, may alter and break off, becauſe not being always requiſite for the Preſervation of Life, they ought not always to be the ſame.</p>
                     <p>But there are Traces in our Brains, that are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally united one with another, as alſo with certain Emotions of the Spirits, becauſe ſuch a Connexion is neceſſary for the Preſervation of Life; and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion cannot be broken off, or at leaſt, not very eaſily, becauſe it's convenient that it ſhould be always the ſame. For Example, the Trace of a Precipice which a Man ſees under himſelf, and from which he is in danger of falling, or of ſome great Body which is ready to fall upon us, and cruſh us to Death, is Naturally join'd to the Trace which repreſents Death, as alſo to an Emotion of the Spirits, which diſpoſes us to fly, or deſire an Eſcape. This Connexion of Traces never changes, becauſe it is neceſſary that it ſhould be always the ſame; and it conſiſts in a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Fibres of the Brain, which we have from our Birth.</p>
                     <p>All thoſe Connexions which are not Natural, may, and ought to be broken, becauſe the various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Time and Place ought to alter them, ſo that they may be uſeful to the Preſervation of Life. 'Tis convenient, for Example, that Partridges ſhould fly from Men with Birding-Pieces in their Hands, eſpecially at ſuch times, and in ſuch places, where Men are accuſtomed to Hunt after them; but it is not neceſſary that they ſhould fly at other times, and in other places. Thus, for the Preſervation of all Creatures, 'tis neceſſary that there ſhould be certain Connexions of Traces, which may be eaſily form'd and deſtroy'd; and that there ſhould be others, which may not be broken without great difficulty. And laſtly, others which are never to be broken.</p>
                     <p>'Tis very uſeful, to enquire carefully into the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Effects, which theſe different Connexions are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing; for they are very numerous, and of great importance for the Underſtanding of Man, and of all things, between him and which there is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:60613:114"/>any Relation. We ſhall find in the ſequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, that theſe Things are the Principal Cauſe of our Errors: But 'tis time to return to what we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to treat of, and to explain the different Changes that befal the Imagination of Men, by reaſon of their various Manner of Living.</p>

                     <p>THE Differences that are in the various Manners of Mens Living, are almoſt Infinite. There are a great Number of different Conditions, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Societies. Theſe Differences are the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that almoſt all Men purſue different Deſigns, and argue upon different Principles. It would be very difficult to meet with ſeveral Perſons, who have abſolutely the ſame Proſpects in one, and the ſame Community, wherein particular Perſons ought to be all of the ſame Spirit, and have the ſame Deſigns: Their different Employs and Converſation, do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily give a different Turn and Humour in the way of Managing the Execution of thoſe Things in which they agree: This ſhews, that it would be an impoſſible Undertaking to particularize the Moral Cauſes of Error. But beſides, it would be of no uſe to do it here, 'tis our buſineſs only to ſpeak of ſuch Manners of Living, as betray Men into the greateſt Number of Errors, and to ſuch as are of the higheſt Importance. When we ſhall have Explained thoſe, we ſhall have open'd a Way ſufficient to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Mind to proceed farther, and every body may be able to Survey, at once, and very eaſily, the moſt bidden Cauſes of ſeveral particular Errors, which
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60613:114"/>cannot be explain'd but with a great deal of Time and Labour. When the Mind ſees clearly, it delights it ſelf with purſuing Truth, which it does with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible ſwiftneſs.
<note place="margin">I. <hi>That Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are the mſt ſubject to Error.</hi>
                        </note> The Employment which ſeems moſt neceſſary to be treated of in this place, becauſe it produces the moſt conſiderable changes in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of Men, and which lead us moſt into Error, is the Employment of Studious Perſons, who make more uſe of their Memory than Wit. For Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience always ſhews us, that they who apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves moſt eagerly to the Reading of Books, and to Search after Truth, are thoſe who have lead us into the greateſt number of Errors.</p>
                     <p>'Tis the ſame thing with thoſe that Study, as with thoſe that Travel. When a Traveller, by misfortune, has taken the wrong Road, the farther he advances, the more remote he is from the Place whither he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to go; and the more diligent and haſty he is to arrive to the end of his Journey, the more he wanders out of the way. In like manner, thoſe ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires which Men have for Truth, cauſe 'em to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate themſelves into the Reading of Books, where they think to find it; or to frame to themſelves a Chimerical Syſteme of things which they deſire to know, for which they have a ſtrong fancy, and which they endeavour by the vain Efforts of Wit to make others reliſh, to the end they may receive the Honour which is uſually due to the Inventors of Syſtemes. Now let us explain theſe two Defects.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a difficult thing to apprehend, how it comes to paſs, that Men of Senſe ſhould rather chooſe to make uſe of other Perſons Judgment in the Search of Truth, than of that which God has beſtow'd upon 'em. Without doubt, there is infinitely much more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and honour for a Man to guide himſelf with his own than other Men's Eyes; nor does any Man who has good Eyes ever dream of ſhutting 'em, or of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting 'em out, in hopes of one to guide him; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs 'tis the ſame thing with the uſe of Judgment as with the uſe of the Eyes; for as the Judgment is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>nitely above the Eyes, the uſe of it is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60613:115"/>with ſatisfactions far more ſolid, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it after another manner, than Light and Colours do the Sight. However Men always make uſe of their own Eyes to be their Guides; but they ſeldom or never make uſe of their own Judgment to diſcover the Truth.</p>
                     <p>But there are ſeveral Cauſes which contribute to this ſame Perturbation of the Mind.
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Reaſons why they rather chooſe to follow Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority than make uſe of their own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                        </note> Firſt, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Sloath of Men, that will not give themſelves the Trouble of Meditation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Their Inability of Meditating, into which they are fallen, for want of applying themſelves to it in their Youth, as has been ſhew'd in the Ninth Chapter.</p>
                     <p>In the third place, the little Love Men have for Abſtracted Truths; which are the foundation of every thing that is to be known here below.</p>
                     <p>In the fourth place, the Satisfaction that Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Knowledge of Probabilities, which are very agreeable and very ſenſible, becauſe they are built upon Taking Notions.</p>
                     <p>In the fifth place, that fooliſh Vanity which makes us covet to be eſteem'd Learned: For we call thoſe Learned who have Read moſt. The knowledge of Opinions is of more uſe in Converſation, and to be able to puzzle the Minds of the Common Sort, than the knowledge of true Philoſophy which is attain'd by Meditation.</p>
                     <p>In the ſixth place, becauſe Men, without any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, imagine, that the Ancients were more enlightened than we can be; and that there is nothing farther for us to Search after, but what they have already been ſucceſsful in finding out.</p>
                     <p>In the ſeventh place, a certain falſe Reſpect, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix'd with fooliſh Curioſity, cauſes us more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Things that are moſt remote, the moſt ancient, and that come from Countreys unknown; and even the moſt obſcure Books.
<note place="margin">Clarus ob obſcuram Linguam Lueres.</note> Thus was <hi>Heraclitus</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore admir'd for his Obſcurity. Men enquire for old Medals, though all defac'd with Ruſt, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as the Apple of their Eye, the Lanthorn, or
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60613:115"/>Slipper of ſome ancient Philoſophers, though almoſt eaten up with Worms; their Antiquity enhaunces their Price. Some apply themſelves to Read the Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, becauſe they wrote in a ſtrange Language, very corrupt and very obſcure. Men have a high Eſteem for Ancient Opinions, becauſe Time has remov'd 'em at a great diſtance from us. And doubtleſs, had <hi>Nimrod</hi> wrote the Hiſtory of his own Reign, all the moſt refin'd Politicks, all the Sciences, had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in it; even as there are ſome who diſcover, that <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> had the Knowledge of all the Secrets of Nature. Antiquity is to be reſpected, they crie. How! could <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Epicurus,</hi> thoſe Great Men, be deceiv'd? They never conſider that <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> were Men as we are, and of the ſame Mould and Shape; and that now the World is grown Two thouſand years older;
<note place="margin">Veritas filia tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris non autherita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</note> that it has more Experience, that it ought to be more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd; and that it is the Age of the World and Experience that enable us to diſcover the Truth.</p>
                     <p>In the Eighth place, becauſe that when a new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or an Author of the time is cried up, it ſeems that their Fame ecclipſes ours, becauſe it ſhines too near it; but they are afraid of no ſuch Injury from the Honour which they pay the Ancients.</p>
                     <p>In the Ninth place, becauſe Truth and Novelty can never concur together in Matters of Faith. For Men not being willing to make a diſtinction between Truths that depend upon Reaſon, and thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Tradition, never conſider that they ought to be apprehended after a very different manner. They confound Novelty with Errors, and Antiquity with Truth. <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> and others have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Innovations, and have been miſtaken, therefore <hi>Galileo, Harvey,</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes</hi> are miſtaken in their Diſcoveries. The Impannation of <hi>Luther</hi> is new, and likewiſe falſe; therefore the Circulation of <hi>Harvey</hi> is falſe, becauſe it is new. For this Reaſon it is, that they indifferently, beſtow that Odious name of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators, both upon Hereticks and new Philoſophers. The Idea's and Words of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Antiquity,</hi> of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60613:116"/>
                        <hi>Falſhood</hi> and <hi>Novelty</hi> have been joined together There's no remedy; the Common ſort never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate 'em, and Men of Senſe find difficulty enough in it.</p>
                     <p>In the Tenth place, becauſe we live in a Time wherein the Knowledge of the Ancient Opinions is ſtill in vogue; and becauſe there are none but thoſe that make uſe of their Judgment, who can by Force of their Reaſon wreſt themſelves from the Contagion of Depraved Cuſtoms. When we are in the Throng and the Croud, 'tis a hard matter not to give way to the Impetuoſity of the Torrent that carries us along with it.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place, becauſe Men act only upon tho ſcore of Intereſt; and this is the Reaſon, that even they who deceive themſelves, and who perceive the vanity of theſe ſorts of Studies, ceaſe not to apply themſelves to 'em for all that; becauſe Honours, Dignities, and Benefices are annexed to 'em; and for that they are always more capable of 'em, who excel in thoſe ſorts of Studies, than thoſe that are ignorant of 'em.</p>
                     <p>All theſe Reaſons, in my Opinion, ſufficiently ſhews us why Men blindly follow the ancient Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as True; and why, without any Judgment, they reject the new ones, as Falſe: In a word, why they make none or very little uſe of their Judgment. There are, without queſtion, a great number of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more particular which contribute to it; but if thoſe which we have produced, be but attentively conſider'd, there will be no cauſe of ſurprize to ſee how ſome People are prejudic'd with the Authority of the Ancients.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Of the Ill Effects that Reading has upon the Imagination.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THis ſame Falſe and unworthy Reſpect, which Men have for the Ancients, produces a great number of moſt pernicious Effects, which it is convenient to obſerve.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that want of uſing their own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, does, by little and little, really diſable Men from making any uſe of it at all. For it is not to be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd, that they who grow old over the Volumes of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> make uſe of their Judgment; they commonly ſpend ſo much time in the Reading of thoſe Books, only to endeavour to know the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of their Authors; and their principal aim is, to know certainly what Opinions they held, without ever troubling themſelves much, whither they be conſentaneous to Reaſon or no, as we ſhall prove in the following Chapter. Thus the Science, and Philoſophy which they learn, is properly a Science of Memory, and not a Science of Judgment: They only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Hiſtories, and Matters of Fact, not evident Truths; and they are rather Hiſtorians than true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Effect, which the Reading of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients produces in the Imagination, is, that it puts a ſtrange confuſion into all their Idea's who apply themſelves to it. There are two different ways to read Authors; the one very good, and very proſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; the other very uſeleſs, and even dangerous 'Tis very profitable to read, when we meditate upon what we read: When Men endeavour to find out, by ſome effect of their Wit, how to reſolve the Queſtions which they meet with in the Titles of the Chapters, before they begin to read them: When they digeſt, and compare the Idea's of things one with another:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60613:117"/>In a word, when they make uſe of their Reaſon. On the other ſide, there is no Profit in Reading, when Men underſtand not what they read; but 'tis dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for Men to read, and conceive what they read, when they never examine it ſufficiently, to make a good Judgment of it; eſpecially, if they have Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enough to retain what they have conceiv'd, and do not unwarily aſſent to what they have read and underſtood. The firſt way enlightens the Mind, it fortifies it, and enlarges its Capacity: The ſecond contracts its Extenſion, and by little and little, renders it both weak, obſcure and confus'd.</p>
                     <p>Now the greateſt part of thoſe who boaſt of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Opinions of others, never Study but after the ſecond Manner; and ſo the more Reading they have, the more their Judgment becomes Feeble and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd. The Reaſon is, becauſe the Traces of their Brains are confounded one with another, being very numerous; and becauſe Reaſon has not digeſted 'em in order; which hinders the Mind from imagining and repreſenting clearly to it ſelf the Things which it ſtands in need of. When the Mind goes about to open certain Traces, meeting with others more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, it never ſeeks another Paſſage. For the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paciouſneſs of the Brain not being Infinite, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but the great number of Traces form'd irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly, muſt interfere one with another, and cauſe a Confuſion among the Idea's: 'Tis for this very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that Perſons that have great Memories are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of judging ſuch things as require much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                     <p>But that which is chiefly to be obſerved is this, that the Knowledge they acquire, who Read without Meditation, are only to retain the Opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. In a word, that all Sciences that depend upon the Memory, are properly theſe kinds of Knowledge that puff Men up, becauſe they make a great noiſe, and infuſe a World of Vanity into thoſe that poſſeſs them. Thus, they who are learned after that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, being uſually full of Pride and Preſumption, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they have a Right to Judge of every thing, tho'
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60613:117"/>they are very uncapable; which cauſes them to fall into a great number of Errors.</p>
                     <p>But this falſe Knowledge does more miſchief ſtill; for theſe Perſons fall not alone into Error, they draw along with them almoſt all the Minds of the Vulgar ſort, and a very great Number of young People, who believe all their Deciſions as ſo many Articles of Faith. Theſe falſely Learned, having often prevail'd over them, with the weight of their profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and having deafned them, as well with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Opinions, as with the Names of ancient and unknown Authors, have gain'd ſo powerful an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them, that they reſpect and admire, as Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, whatever they utter, and no leſs unadviſedly, embrace all their Sentiments. Perſons alſo, much much Ingenious, and more Judicious, who had never known them before, or could not be inform'd by others what they are, hearing them talk at ſuch a rate, and with ſo haughty, ſo imperious, and grave an Air, would have much ado to refrain their reſpect and eſteem for what they ſay, becauſe it is a difficult thing to forbear paying ſomewhat to Air and Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For, as it often happens, that a Man who is fierce and daring, abuſes others who are ſtronger, but more prudent and moderate than himſelf; ſo they, who maintain Things which are neither true nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, put their Adverſaries to Silence, by ſpeaking after an imperious, haughty, and grave manner, which ſurprizes them. Now theſe People, of whom we ſpeak, have a high Conceit of themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe other Men, as being fortify'd with a certain Air of Pride, intermix'd with Gravity, and a Counterfeit Modeſty, which prepoſſeſſes, and wins thoſe that hear them.</p>
                     <p>For it is to be obſerv'd, that all the different Airs of Perſons of different Conditions, are only the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſequences of that Eſteem which every Man has of himſelf, in reference to others, as it is eaſie to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if we never ſo little conſider it. Thus the Air of Fierceneſs and Brutality, is that of a Man, that magnifies himſelf, and little values the Merit of others.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60613:118"/>The Modeſt Air, is that of a Man, who has a low Conceit of himſelf, a high Eſteem for others. The Grave Air, is that of a Man, who has a high Conceit of himſelf, and greatly Ambitious of others Eſteem. And the Simple Air, is that of one who has no great Conceit either of himſelf, or of any body elſe. So that all the different Airs, which are almoſt Infinite, are only the Effects which the different Degrees of Eſteem that Men have of themſelves, or of thoſe with whom they Converſe, naturally produce in our looks, and over all the Exterior parts of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. We have in the Fourth Chapter, explain'd the Correſpondence between the Nerves that raiſe the Paſſions within us, and thoſe which demonſtrate them outwardly, by the Air which they Imprint upon the Face.</p>

                     <p>THere is another fault of great conſequence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into great Students uſually fall; which is, That they Dote upon ſome certain Author. If there be any thing true and good in the Book, they cry it up even to exceſs; every thing is true, the whole is good, every thing in it is to be admir'd. They pleaſe themſelves with admiring what they underſtand not, and they would have all the World admire it as well as themſelves. They aſſume Honour to themſelves, from the Praiſes which they give to thoſe obſcure Authors, becauſe thereby they perſwade others that they underſtand them perfectly well; and this affords them no ſmall occaſion of Vanity. They va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:60613:118"/>themſelves above other Men, becauſe they believe they underſtand a Piece of Impertinency in an Old Author, or in a Man that, perhaps, never underſtood himſelf. How many Learned Men have Sweated, to Illuſtrate ſome obſcure Paſſages of the Ancient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers and Poets; and how many great Wits are there, who make it their whole delight to Criticize upon a Word, or the Sentiment of an Author: But 'tis convenient to bring ſome Inſtance for what I alledge.</p>
                     <p>The Queſtion concerning the Immortality of the Soul, is, without all doubt, a Queſtion of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The Philoſophers are not to be blam'd, for uſing all their endeavours to reſolve it; and tho' they compile large Volumes, to prove, tho' weakly enough, a Truth that may be demonſtrated in a few Words, or in a few Pages at moſt, yet they are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable. But who can refrain from laughing, to ſee them put themſelves to ſuch a World of Trouble, to decide what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought of it: 'Tis, in my Opinion, a thing of little benefit to thoſe that live now, to know whether there were ever ſuch a Man who was call'd <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> whether that Man ever wrote thoſe Books which go under his Name; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he meant ſuch or ſuch a thing, in ſuch a part of his Works; it can neither make a Man more Wiſe, or more Happy: But 'tis of great Importance to know, whether what he has ſaid be true or falſe in it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>'Tis to no purpoſe then, to know what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd touching the Immortality of the Soul, tho' it be of great moment to know that the Soul is Immortal. However, we are not afraid to aſſert, that ſeveral Learned Men have put themſelves to more trouble, to know the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> upon this ſubject, than the Truth of the Thing in it ſelf, ſince there are ſome who have compos'd whole Folio's, on purpoſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold what that Philoſopher believ'd of it, but never did ſo much to know what he ought to have believ'd of it.</p>

                     <p>We give ye all theſe Citations for true, upon the Credit of the Commentator, believing it would be loſs of time to juſtifie them; and becauſe we have not all the Books from whence they were Extracted. Nor do we add any new ones, becauſe we do not envy him the Honour of having well collected them, and for that it would be ſtill more loſs of time, had we a deſire to do it, tho' we ſhould only, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, turn over the Indices of the Commentators up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We ſee then, by this paſſage of <hi>La Cerda,</hi> that Studious Men, who paſs for able Scholars, have put themſelves to the Trouble to know what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd of the Immortality of the Soul, and that there were ſome of them that never ſcrupled to Write Books on purpoſe, upon this ſubject; among whom was <hi>Pomponatius:</hi> For the principal Aim of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, in his Book, is to ſhew that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> believ'd the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60613:120"/>Soul to be Mortal. And, perhaps, there are ſome People, who do not only enquire what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd upon this ſubject, but alſo, look upon it as a Queſtion of great Importance to know, whether, for Example, <hi>Tertullian, Plutarch,</hi> or others, believ'd or not, that the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was, <hi>that the Soul was Mortal,</hi> as we have great reaſon to believe of <hi>La Cerda</hi> himſelf, if we conſider the laſt part of the Paſſage which we have cited, <hi>viz. Porro Tertullianum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>If it be not very Profitable to know what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> thought, concerning the Immortality of the Soul, nor what <hi>Tertullian</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> thought what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, however, the main of the Queſtion about the Immortality, or Mortality of the Soul, is, at leaſt, a Truth very neceſſary to be known. But there are an infinite number of things, the knowledge of which is very unneceſſary, and of which, by conſequence, 'tis to yet leſs purpoſe to know what the Ancients thought of them: Nevertheleſs, they put themſelves to a World of trouble, to gueſs at the Sentiments of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers upon ſubjects of the like Nature. We meet with Books full of theſe Inquiſitions, and theſe are the Triſles that have rais'd ſo many Wars among the Learned. Theſe vain and impertinent Queſtions, theſe frivolous Genealogies of unprofitable Opinions, are the Important ſubjects of the Criticiſms of the Learned: They imagine themſelves the Abſolute Maſters of the Genealogical Hiſtory of ſubſtantial Forms, and the World is Ingrateful if it does not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their Merit. How do theſe things diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the Weakneſs and Vanity of Human Wit! When Reaſon does not, that regulates our Studies; our Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies not only grow incapable of perfecting Reaſon, but even darken, corrupt, and abſolutely pervert it. But 'tis neceſſary here to obſerve, that in Queſtions concerning Faith, they are no way to blame, who ſearch what St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> for Example, or any other Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, have believ'd concerning thoſe things; as neither are they, who enquire whither St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> believ'd what they believ'd who preceded
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60613:120"/>him, becauſe we cannot attain to Matters of Faith, but by Tradition, Reaſon not being able to diſcover them. The moſt Ancient Belief being the moſt true, 'tis requiſite to know what was that Belief of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, which cannot be done but by examining the Opinions of ſeveral Perſons, who ſucceeded each other at different times. But in things that depend upon Reaſon, the caſe is alter'd, and there is a neceſſity for Men to trouble themſelves what the Ancients be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd, that we may know what is needful for our ſelves to believe concerning them: Nevertheleſs, I know not through what confuſion of the Mind, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain People are affrighted, if we ſpeak otherwiſe in Philoſophy than <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> but are never mov'd, if we ſpeak otherwiſe in Divinity than the Goſpel, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and the Councils. It ſeems to me, that they who make the loudeſt noiſe againſt the Novelties of Philoſophy, which ought to be eſteem'd; are they that favour and defend Innovations in Divinity, with the greateſt obſtinacy, and which ought to be deteſted. For 'tis not their Language which we blame, as being Authorized by Cuſtom, tho' altogether unknown to Antiquity, but the Errors which they diſperſe abroad, or which they maintain under the Protection of their confus'd and equivocal Terms.</p>
                     <p>In Matters of Divinity, we ſhou'd follow Antiquity, becauſe we ought to love Truth, and becauſe Truth is found in Antiquity: 'Tis neceſſary that all Curioſity ſhou'd ceaſe, whence once we have ſound out the Truth, but in Matters of Philoſophy 'tis quire the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: we ought to love Novelty, for the ſame reaſon that we ought always to love the Truth; we muſt ſearch after it, and have an unceſſant Curioſity for it. If we thought that <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> were Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible, it wou'd be ſufficient for us to apply our ſelves to underſtand them, but Reaſon will not permit us to believe it; for, on the contrary, it requires that we ſhou'd believe them more ignorant than the New Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, ſince the World is now grown older by two thouſand Years, and has more Experience than it had in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s and <hi>Plato</hi>'s Days, as we have already
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60613:121"/>ſaid; and becauſe the New Philoſophers may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know all the Truths which the Ancients have left behind them, but may likewiſe diſcover many others: Nevertheleſs, Reaſon forbids us to believe theſe New Philoſophers upon their own Words, rather than the Ancients. It requires, on the contrary, that we ſhould diligently examine their Thoughts, and refuſe our Aſſent, till it is impoſſible for us, any longer, to doubt the certainty of their Truth; without being ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly prepoſſed with their great Learning, or other Qualities of their Wit.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THis exceſs of Prejudice, appears much more ſtrange in thoſe who Comment upon any Author, becauſe they, who undertake that Work, which ſeems in it ſelf beneath a Man of Senſe, imagine that their Authors deſerve to be admir'd by all Men. They alſo look upon themſelves, as making but one Perſon with their Author; and with this Conceit, Self-love moſt admirably plays it's part. They are cunningly profuſe in the Praiſes of their Authors; they ſet them off with the beſt advantage, and heap Honours upon them, well knowing that this Honour will reflect upon themſelves. And this Idea of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, does not only magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Plato,</hi> in the Minds of many Perſons, but it imprints alſo a Reſpect for all thoſe that have Commented upon them: And ſuch a one would never have Deify'd his Author, but that he imagin'd himſelf, as it were, comprehended in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>I do not believe, however, that all Commentators praiſe their Authors in hopes of a Return; many would abhor it, if they conſider'd it; they Praiſe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60613:121"/>them ſincerely, and don't think they do it in reſpect to themſelves, but Self-love does it for them, without their perceiving it. Men are not ſenſible of the Heat which is in their Hearts, tho' it gives Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the other parts of their Body; 'tis neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they feel it, by laying their Hands upon their Breaſt, to be convinc'd of it, becauſe that Heat is Natural. 'Tis the ſame thing with Vanity; 'tis ſo Natural to Man, that he is not ſenſible of it, tho' it be that, which, as I may ſo ſay, gives Life and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the greateſt part of his Thoughts and Deſigns; it does it many times, in ſuch a manner, as is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible to him. A Man muſt feel, handle, and ſearch himſelf, to be convinc'd that he is Vain. There's no Man yet, has ſufficiently been ſenſible, that 'tis this Vanity which ſets the firſt Wheel of the greateſt part of our Actions a going; for tho' Self love, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, knows it well enough, yet is that Knowledge to no other end, than to conceal it from all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                     <p>A Commentator then, having ſome Relation and Affinity with the Author, upon whom he Comments, his Self-love fails not to diſcover to him the great ſubjects of Praiſe in that Author, to the end he may reap the benefit of them himſelf: And this is done ſo dexterouſly, ſo ſubtilely, and ſo delicately, that it is not to be perceived. But this is not a place to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the Artifices of Self-love.</p>
                     <p>Commentators not only Praiſe their Authors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are prepoſſeſſed with an Eſteem for them, and becauſe they Honour themſelves in Praiſing them, but alſo, becauſe it is the Cuſtom, and for that it ſeems as if there were a neceſſity of doing it. There are ſome Perſons, who not having any great value for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> not, however, to Comment upon them, and that with great Application too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Employment, Chance, or their own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pritious Fancy, engages them to undertake the Work. And theſe People believe themſelves oblig'd, to extol, after a Hyperbolical manner, the Sciences, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors upon which they Comment, tho' the Authors
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60613:122"/>are Impertinent, and the Sciences mean and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                     <p>And, indeed, it would be a very ridiculous thing for a Man to Comment upon an Author, whom he believes to be Impertinent, and ſeriouſly to apply himſelf to write, in ſuch a manner, as he thought to be of no uſe. He muſt therefore, for his Reputation's ſake, praiſe thoſe Sciences, and thoſe Authors, altho' both were Contemptible, and tho' the fault, which he has committed in undertaking an ill Work, may be repaired by another fault as bad. This is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that Learned Men, who Comment upon different Authors, frequently contradict themſelves.</p>
                     <p>For this Reaſon alſo it is, that almoſt all Prefaces are ſcarce ever agreeable to Truth or good Senſe. If the Comment be upon <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> he is the <hi>Genius of Nature:</hi> If they Write upon <hi>Plato,</hi> he is the <hi>Divine Plato.</hi> They never Comment upon the Works of Men without Additions to their Names. They are always the Works of Men wholly Divine; of Men who are the Admiration of their Age; or ſuch as have received from God particular Gifts. 'Tis the ſame thing alſo, with the Matter which they treat of; 'tis always the moſt Noble, the moſt Sublime, and the moſt uſeful of all other ſubjects.</p>
                     <p>But that I may not be thought to ſpeak upon my own word, ſee here, after what manner a famous Commentator among the Learned, writes of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor upon which he Comments.

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60613:123"/>of <hi>Euclid,</hi> and had Age permitted him, and his Strength not fail'd him, we ſhould have had, by this time, twelve or fifteen large Folio's only upon the Elements of Geometry, which would have been very uſeful to thoſe that are deſirous to learn that Science, and much to the Honour of <hi>Euclid.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe are the odd Deſigns which falſe Learning qualifies us for: This Man underſtood the Greek Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, for we are beholding to him for a Greek Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>'s Works. He had alſo read, perhaps, the Ancient Geometricians: He knew, hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, their Propoſitions, as well as their Genealogy. He had all the ſame Reſpect for Antiquity that Men ought to have for Truth: And what does this ſame Qualification of Wit produce? A Commentary upon the Definitions, Poſtulates, Axioms, and the eight firſt Propoſitions of <hi>Euclid,</hi> much more difficult to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand and retain; I do not ſay, than the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions upon which he Comments, but than all that <hi>Euclid</hi> has Writ upon Geometry.</p>
                     <p>There are many People, whoſe Vanity cauſes them to ſpeak Greek, and ſometimes a Language which they do not underſtand; for Dictionaries, as well as Index's, and Common Places, are a great help to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authors, but there are few Men that caution themſelves, about heaping up Greek upon a ſubject where it is little to the purpoſe to make uſe of it. And this it is, which makes me believe 'twas a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd Opinion, and an irregular Eſteem for <hi>Euclid,</hi> which form'd the deſign of that Book in the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of its Author.</p>
                     <p>Had this Man made as much uſe of his Reaſon as of his Memory, in a ſubject where Reaſon ought to be employ'd; or had he had as much Love and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for Truth, as Veneration for the Author upon whom he Comments, 'tis very probable, that having ſpent ſo much time upon ſo little ſubject, he would have acknowledg'd, that the Definitions which <hi>Euclid</hi> gives of a Plain Angle, and Parallel Lines, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſective, and that they do not ſufficiently explain the Nature of them; and that the ſecond Prepoſition is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60613:124"/>Impertinent, ſince it cannot be prov'd but by the third Poſtulate, which cannot be granted, unleſs you like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grant the ſecond Propoſition. For in granting the third Poſtulate, which is, <hi>On any Centre, and at any Diſtance, to deſcribe a Circle,</hi> they not only grant, that one Line equal to the other, may be drawn from a Point, which <hi>Euclid</hi> demonſtrates by great Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutions in his ſecond Propoſition, but alſo, that an infinite number of Lines, of any length, may be drawn from every Point.</p>
                     <p>But the Deſign of the moſt part of Commentators is not to illuſtrate their Authors, and to enquire after Truth, but to ſhew their Learning, and inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deſend the faults themſelves, of thoſe upon whom they Comment: They ſpeak not ſo much to be underſtood themſelves, or to make their Authors to be underſtood, as to procure Admiration to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and them. Had not the Perſon, whom we have mention'd, ſtuft his Book with Greek Paſſages, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Names of Authors little known, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of the ſame Nature, of little uſe to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Common Notions, Definitions of Names, and Poſtulates in Geometry, who would have read his Book? Who would have admir'd him? And who would have given the Author of it, the Title of a Learned Man, or a Man of Senſe?</p>
                     <p>After what has been ſaid, I do not believe it can be doubted, that the indiſcreet Reading of Authors often prepoſſeſſes the Mind. Now ſo ſoon as the Mind of a Man is prepoſſeſs'd, he ceaſes to be owner of what we call Common Senſe: He can no longer give a found Judgment upon any thing, that has Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſubject of his Prejudic'd Opinion, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects every thing he thinks on; he can apply himſelf but very little to any thing, beſides what he is Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic'd in favour of. Thus a Man that admires <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> can never reliſh any body but <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> he Judges of every thing as it relates to <hi>Ariſtotle;</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contrary to his Philoſophy, is in his Opinion falſe, he will have always ſome Paſſage of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Mouth; he will Quote him upon all occaſions,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:60613:124"/>and upon all ſorts of ſubjects; to prove things ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, which no body underſtands, to prove things as clear as day, and which are known to every Child i'th' Street: 'tis all one, becauſe that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is to him what Reaſon and Evidence are to others.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, if a Man Dote upon <hi>Euclid,</hi> and Geometry, he ſhall refer to the Lines and Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Author, whatever you ſay to him: He will not talk to ye, but his Words ſhall have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon his Science. The whole ſhall not be greater than a part, only becauſe <hi>Euclid</hi> ſays it, and he will not be aſham'd to Quote him to prove it, as I have obſerv'd. But this is much more uſual with thoſe who adhere to other Authors than thoſe of Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry; and we frequently find large Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic Paſſages in their Books, to prove things that are perfectly evident.</p>
                     <p>All this befalls them, becauſe the <hi>Traces,</hi> which the Objects of their Prejudic'd Opinion have imprinted on the Fibres of their Brains, are ſo deep, that they always remain open, and for that the Animal Spirits, paſſing continually quite through them, will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to cloſe: So that the Mind, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to have always thoſe Thoughts that are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to the Traces, ſhe becomes, as it were, their Slave, and is always troubled and diſquieted by them, when knowing her Errors, ſhe endeavours to apply a Remedy to them. Thus the Mind is continually in danger of falling into a great number of Errors, if ſhe does not always ſtand upon her Guard, and, with an unalterable Reſolution, obſerve the Rule which we have ſpoken of at the beginning of this Work, that is to ſay, <hi>never to aſſent but to Things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely evident.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſpeak not here of the ill choice of thoſe Studies to which they apply themſelves, that is a ſubject to be handled in E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>ics, tho' it might be referr'd to what has been ſaid concerning Prejudic'd Opinions: For when a Man throws himſelf deſperately upon the ſtudy of the Rabbins, and other Books in all forts of Languages, and conſequently the moſt unprofitable,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60613:125"/>and waſtes his whole Life therein, he does it, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, out of a Prejudic'd Opinion, and an Imaginary hope of becoming Learned, tho' he will never be able to acquire any real Knowledge by this way of Study. But becauſe this Application to an unprofitable Study, does not ſo much lead us into Error, as it waſtes our Time, and fills us with a fooliſh Vanity, we ſhall not here diſcourſe of thoſe, who take pains to become Learned in all ſorts of mean, or unprofitable Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whoſe Number is very great, and who, for the moſt part, Study with too much Paſſion.</p>

                     <p>WE have ſhew'd the State of the Imagination of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Perſons, who abandon themſelves wholly to the Authority of certain Authors: There are others, who are very much oppoſite to them. Theſe are a ſort of Perſons that never reſpect any Authors, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eſteem they have among the Learned: If they had a Value for them once, they have ſince chang'd their Minds, and now they ſet up themſelves for Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. They would fain become the Inventors of ſome New Opinion, thereby to acquire ſome Reputation in the World; and they aſſure themſelves, that if they can but ſay ſomething that has not been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, they ſhall not fail of Admirers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſort of Men have uſually a ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Fibres of their Brain are of ſuch a Nature, that they preſerve a long time, the Traces that are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in them. Thus, when they have once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd a Syſtem that has ſome Probability, 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to undeceive them of their Error: They retain, and tenderly preſerve all things, that may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60613:125"/>in any manner, to confirm it. On the other ſide, they never take notice of the Objections which are made againſt it, or elſe they evade them by ſome frivolous diſtinction. Inwardly they pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſight of their Work, and with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which they hope to get by it. They only ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to conſider the Image of Truth, which their probable Opinions carry: They keep that Image fix'd before their Eyes, but they never ſtedfaſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thoſe other ſides of their Sentiments, which would diſcover the falſhood of them.</p>
                     <p>Great Endowments are requir'd for the framing of any true Syſtem; it's neceſſary that there be a great vivacity and ſharpneſs, beſides a certain ſublimeneſs and extenſion of Judgment, able to ſurvey a great number of things at the ſame time. Men of mean parts, with all their vivacity, and all their delicacy, are too ſhort ſighted, to ſee what is neceſſary for the Compoſing of a Syſtem; they ſtoop at ſome little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that diſcourage them, or at ſome glimmerings that dazle them: They have not a fight ſharp enough to ſurvey the whole Body of a large ſubject, all at a time.</p>
                     <p>But let the Extent and Penetration of the Mind, be never ſo great, if it be not withal exempt from Paſſion and Prejudice, there is little to be expected from it; Prejudices poſſeſs one part of the Mind, and infect the reſt; Paſſions confound the Idea's a thouſand ways, and repreſent to us, in Objects, whatever we deſire to find there. That Paſſion alſo, which we have for Truth it ſelf, ſometimes deceives us, when it is too vehement; but the deſire of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing Learned, is that which drives us fartheſt off from attaining true Knowledge.</p>
                     <p>There is nothing more rate, than to meet with Perſons capable of making new Syſtems; but it is not ſo rare a thing, to meet with ſuch as have compos'd Syſtems after their own Fancies. There are few People, that Study much, who argue according to Common Notions, there is always ſome Irregulari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y in their Idea's; and this ſufficiently ſhews, that they
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60613:126"/>
rely upon ſome particular Syſtems, which is not known to us: 'Tis true, that all the Books which they Compoſe do not make it manifeſt; for when we ſettle our ſelves to Write any Book, which we deſign to Publiſh, we take heed, as near as is poſſible, of what is to be ſaid; and this Attention alone, is oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſufficient to convince us of our Error. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, we ſee from time to time, ſome Books which prove ſufficiently what we have ſaid; for there are Authors, who pride themſelves in obſerving, at the beginning of their Book, that they have invented ſome new Syſtem.</p>
                     <p>The Number of Inventors of New Syſtems, is alſo very much augmented, by Prejudices conceiv'd againſt ſome Authors; for it often happens, that becauſe they have not met with any thing true or ſolid, in the Opinions of thoſe Authors which they have read, they fall, in the firſt place, into a great diſlike and ſcorn of all ſorts of Books, and afterwards imagine a new Opinion, that carries ſome Probability, which they greedily embrace, and which becomes more deeply rooted in them, in ſuch manner as we have ſet forth.</p>
                     <p>But when this extraordinary Zeal, which they have for their Opinion, grows cool, or the deſign of tranſmitting it to the Publick, has oblig'd them to examine it more exactly and ſeriouſly, they diſcover, and quit the falſhood; but with this condition, that they will never embrace any others, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all thoſe who pretend to have diſcover'd any Truth.</p>

                        </note> and moſt dangerous Error of Studious Perſons, is this, that they believe there is nothing can be certainly known: They have read ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Books, both Ancient and Modern, wherein they could not meet with Truth; they have had ſeveral curious Thoughts, which, upon a more ſtrict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they have found falſe. From whence they conclude, that all Men are like them, and that if they, who believe they have conſider'd ſome Truths, would but a little more ſeriouſly conſider them, they would
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:60613:126"/>
be convinc'd of their Errors, as well as themſelves. This to them, is ſufficient to condemn 'em without entring into any farther particular Examination; ſince, if they did not condemn 'em, it would in ſome meaſure be an acknowledgment, that they had more Wit than themſelves; which they are not apt to think very probable.</p>
                     <p>Therefore they eſteem, as obſtinate, all thoſe that hold any thing for certain; nor will they by any means hear talk of the Sciences as Evident Truths, which are beyond all contradiction, but only as Opinions of which it is not convenient to be ignorant: However theſe Perſons ought to conſider, that though they have read a great number of Books, yet they have not read all, or at leaſt with that attention which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the right underſtanding 'em; or if they had many curious thoughts which they ſound falſe in the concluſion, it does not follow they had all the thoughts they might have had; and ſo it's poſſible that others have done better than they. For all this, it is not neceſſary that the others ſhould have more Senſe than they, if that be the buſineſs that offends 'em, for it's enough that they were only more Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; Nor is there any wrong done 'em by thoſe who profeſs to know evidently what they are ignorant of, ſince they ſay at the ſame time, that ſeveral Ages have been ignorant of the ſame Truths; not for want of good Wits, but becauſe theſe good Wits did not firſt light upon them.</p>

all that other Men know, or all that other Men can know. For if they had not theſe thoughts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their Anſwer were ſtill more impertinent. And why do they think it ſo difficult a thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they know nothing of it, when upon certain Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions they grant that they knew nothing at all? And wherefore muſt they conclude that all other Men are ignorant, becauſe they are inwardly convinc'd that they themſelves are ignorant?</p>
                     <p>There are theſe three ſorts of Perſons who apply themſelves to Study. The firſt doat to little purpoſe upon ſome Author, or ſome falſe unuſeful Science. The ſecond are prepoſſeſt in their own Fancies. The laſt, which partake of the Qualifications of both the former, are they who imagine they know all that can be known; and who being perſuaded that they know nothing of certainty, conclude in general, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be evidently known; and look upon all things that are propos'd to 'em as meer Opinions.</p>
                     <p>'Tis eaſie to ſee that all the Defects of theſe three ſorts of Perſons, depend upon the Properties of the Imagination, which we have explain'd in the Tenth and Eleventh Chapters, but chiefly in the Firſt, that all this befalls 'em only through Prejudices, in Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that blind their Minds, and will not permit 'em to apprehend any other Objects than thoſe of their Prepoſſeſſions. It may be ſaid that their Prejudices act their Minds, as the Miniſters of Princes do in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their Maſters. For as thoſe Perſons, do, as much as in 'em lies, never permit any but ſuch as are devoted to their Intereſts, or ſuch as they are no way afraid of, to ſpeak to their Maſters; ſo the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of theſe Men will not permit the Mind to behold with a fixed Eye the Idea's of Objects that are wholly pure and unmix'd; but they diſguiſe 'em; they cover 'em with their Liveries, and preſent 'em in that manner all maſqu'd; ſo that 'tis a difficult thing for 'em to undeceive themſelves, and acknowledge their Errors.</p>

                     <p>WHat we have ſaid, is ſufficient, in my Opinion, to ſet forth in general what are the Defects of the Imagination in Studious Perſons, and the Errors to which they are moſt ſubject. Now in regard there are none but theſe Perſons who trouble themſelves with Searching after Truth, and becauſe all the reſt of Mankind depends upon them for it, it might be thought that we ſhould here conclude this Second Part. Nevertheleſs, 'tis convenient to ſay ſomething more concerning the Errors of other Men, becauſe it will not be amiſs to know what they are.

                           </gap>e Wits.</note> Whatever flatters the Senſes, extreamly affects us; and to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever affects us, we apply our ſelves proportionably to the pleaſure we take in it. Thus they, who give themſelves up to all manner of the moſt ſenſible and pleaſing Divertiſements, are incapable of penetrating Truths that include any conſiderable difficulty; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Receptacle of the Mind, which is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, is wholly taken up with their Pleaſures, or at leaſt they have a very great ſhare therein.</p>
                     <p>The generality of Great Men, Courtiers, Rich Men, young People, and they that are call'd by the name of fine Wits, being taken up with continual Paſtimes, and only Studying the Art of flattering their Concupiſcence and Voluptuous Appetites, by degrees acquire ſuch a Delicacy of Skill in theſe things, or rather ſuch a Softneſs, that they may be often ſaid to be rather Effeminate than fine Wits, as they pretend to be. For there is a great difference between Fineneſs and Softneſs of Wit, though they are generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded one with another.</p>
                     <pb n="210" facs="tcp:60613:128"/>
                     <p>Fine Wits are they who diſcern, by the Conduct of Reaſon, the moſt minute differences of things, who foreſee the uncommon and almoſt imperceptible Effects that depend upon Hidden Cauſes: In ſhort, theſe are they who penetrate into the Subjects which they conſider. But ſoft Wits have nothing but a falſe Delicacy; they are neither lively nor pierceing; they diſcern not the Effects from the Cauſes, even of the moſt groſs palpable thing: Laſtly, they neither apprehend nor penetrate into any thing, but are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly nice as to Manners; A Clowniſh Word, the Accent of a particular County, a little Grimace, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes 'em more than a torrent of confus'd and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Arguments; they cannot know the Defect of Reaſoning, but are immediately very ſenſible of a falſe Meaſure, or an irregular Geſture: In ſhort, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſenſible things perfectly, becauſe they keep their Senſes in continual Exerciſe; but they want the true underſtanding of things that depend upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, becauſe they ſeldom or never make uſe of their own.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, theſe are the Perſons who are moſt eſteemed in the World, and eaſily acquire the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Curious Wits. For when a Man ſpeaks with a free and diſengag'd Air; when his Expreſſions are pure and well choſen, when he makes uſe of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile's that flatter the Senſes, and move the Affections after an imperceptible manner, though he utter no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but trivial things, though there be nothing found, nothing true in all his fine Words, He, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Common Opinion, ſhall be cried up for a Curious Wit, a Refin'd Wit, a Poliſh'd Wit. They never perceive that he is only a Soft Effeminate Wit, and ſhines only by falſe Lights, that never enlighten the Mind; and that his perſuaſions prevail only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have Eyes, but not becauſe we have Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We do not deny but that all Men are in ſome meaſure guilty of this weakneſs, which we have obſerv'd in ſome. There is not any Man whoſe Mind is not touch'd by the Impreſſions of his Senſes and Affections, and who by conſequence is not a little
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60613:128"/>
ſway'd by outward Formalities and Language. As to this, all Men differ but in the more or the leſs. But the reaſon why this defect is attributed to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, is this; becauſe there are ſome who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it to be a fault, and ſtrive to reform it. Whereas they, who have been mentioned by us, look upon it as a very advantageous Accompliſhment. Far from acknowledging this ſame falſe Delicacy to be the Effect of an Effeminate Softneſs, and the Original of an Infinite number of the Diſeaſes of the Mind; they imagine it to be an Effect and Mark of the Beauty of their Genius.</p>
                     <p>To theſe, of whom we have ſpoken,
<note place="margin">Of Superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Wits.</note> we may join a very great number of Superficial Wits, who never dive into any thing, and who never apprehend, unleſs it be confuſedly, the differences of things; Not through their own fault, as in thoſe before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for their Minds are neither fill'd up, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by their Divertiſements only they have natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Slender Wits. However this ſame Slenderneſs of Wit, proceeds not from the Nature of the Soul, as may be well imagin'd; but it is caus'd ſometimes by the great ſcarcity, or the more than ordinary ſlowneſs of the Animal Spirits, ſometimes through the Inflexibility of the Fibres of the Brain; ſometimes alſo through an immoderate abundance of Spirits and Blood, or for ſome other Reaſon which it is not worth while to examine.</p>
                     <p>There are then two ſorts of Wits. Some readily obſerve the difference of things; and theſe are True Wits. Others imagine and ſuppoſe a Reſemblance between 'em, and theſe are Superficial Wits. The firſt have a Brain proper to receive clean and diſtinct Traces of the Objects which they conſider; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are very attentive to the Idea's of the Traces, they ſee thoſe Objects, as it were, near at hand, and nothing eſcapes 'em. But Superficial Wits receive none but feeble or confus'd Traces of their Objects. They ſee 'em only, as it were, curſorily at a diſtance and very confuſedly; ſo that they ſeem alike to 'em, like the Faces of thoſe which we ſee
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60613:129"/>
afar off, becauſe the Mind ſuppoſes always Likeneſs and Equality, for the Reaſons which I ſhall give in the Third Book.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt part of thoſe that ſpeak in Publick, all thoſe that are call'd great Talkers, and many of thoſe who are fluent of Speech, though they ſpeak but little, are of this ſort. For they who meditate ſeriouſly and accurately, are very rarely known to have a Copious Utterance of their own Meditations. Uſually they heſitate when they begin to ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſomewhat cautious of making uſe of Terms that excite in others a falſe Idea, being aſham'd to ſpeak meerly for Talkings ſake, like many that ſpeak boldly of every thing that comes next 'em; they are therefore concern'd to find out Words proper to expreſs, as they ought to do, their thoughts, which are not common.</p>
                     <p>Though we have a great Veneration for Perſons of Piety, Divines, Old Men, and generally for all thoſe who have juſtly acquir'd great Authority over other Men, nevertheleſs we thought our ſelves oblig'd to ſay this of 'em, it often happens that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves infallible, becauſe all other Men hearken to 'em with Reſpect; becauſe they make little uſe of their Reaſon in the diſcovery of Speculative Truths, and for that they condemn with too much freedom, whatever they diſlike, before they have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider'd it. Not that they are to be blam'd for not applying themſelves to many Sciences of little uſe; for they are allow'd both to let 'em alone, and to deſpiſe them if they think convenient; but they are not to judge of 'em raſhly as their fancies lead 'em, nor upon ill grounded ſuſpitions. For they are to conſider, that the Gravity of their Delivery, the Authority which they have acquir'd over the Minds of Men and their common cuſtom of confirming what they ſay by ſome Paſſage of the Holy Scripture, will infallibly lead into Error all thoſe that liſten to 'em out of Reſpect, and who being incapable throughly to examine things, ſuffer themſelves to be ſurpriz'd by Manners and Appearances.</p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:60613:129"/>
                     <p>When Error hath the appearance of Truth, it is oftimes more reſpected than Truth it ſelf; and this falſe Reſpect is attended with dangerous Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies. <hi>Peſſima res eſt errorum Apotheoſis, &amp; pro peſte intellectus habenda eſt; ſi vanis accedat veneratio.</hi> Thus, when certain Perſons, either out of falſe Zeal, or out of a Love for their own thoughts, have made uſe of Scripture to eſtabliſh falſe Principles of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, or any other Science, they have oft been li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd to as Oracles by Men that have believ'd 'em upon their Words, becauſe of that Veneration which they owe to Sacred Authority; but it has likewiſe happen'd ſo, that Vicious and Corrupted Minds have hence taken an occaſion to deſpiſe Religion: So that by a ſtrange Inverſion, the Holy Scripture has been the Cauſe of Error to ſome, and Truth has been the Motive and Original of Impiety to others. We ought therefore to be careful, as the Author above cited well obſerves, how we ſeek for dead things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the living, and never to pretend by the ſtrength of our own Wits to diſcover in Sacred Scripture what the Holy Ghoſt hath not thought fit to reveal. <hi>Ex divinorum &amp; humanorum maleſana admixtione,</hi> continues <hi>he, non ſolum educitur Philoſophia Phantaſtica, ſed etiam Religio Haretica.

St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us in his 5th Book of <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> When I ſee, ſays he, a Chriſtian that is not acquainted with the Opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, concerning the Heavens, the Stars, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Sun and Moon, and would take one thing for an other; I let 'em alone in theſe Opinions and Doubts: For I don't ſee that Ignorance in the ſituation of Bodies, the different ordering of Matter, can injure 'em; provided he has not unworthy Sentiments of thee our Lord, who art the Creator of us all. But it does him an Injury, if he is perſuaded that theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Religion, and if he is ſo bold as obſtinately to affirm what he knows not. The ſame Saint explains his Thoughts yet more clearly upon this Subject in the firſt Book of the <hi>Literal Explication of Geneſis</hi> in theſe Terms: A Chriſtian muſt take a great deal of Care that he does not ſpeak of theſe Things, as if they
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:60613:130"/>
were Holy Scripture, for an Infidel who ſhould hear him ſpeak Extravigances that ſhould have no appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Truth could not forbear laughing at him, ſo the Chriſtian is only Confounded, and the Infidel would be very little Edified. Yet what is more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous in theſe Encounters than a Man's being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, is, that theſe Infidels that we endeavour to Convert, imagine falſely, and to their inevitable ruine, that our Authors have very extravigant Sentiments; ſo that they condemn and deſpiſe 'em as ignorant Men; it is therefore in my Opinion more proper, not to affirm the common receiv'd Opinions of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as Matters of Faith, which are not contrary to our Faith, although we may ſometimes make uſe of the Authority of Philoſophers to make 'em be receiv'd. We muſt not alſo reject theſe Opinions as contrary to our Faith, that we may give no occaſion to the Wiſe Men of this World to Diſpute the holy Truths of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                     <p>The greateſt part of Mankind are ſo negligent and void of Reaſon, that they make no diſtinction between the Word of God and that of Men, when they are joined together, ſo that they fall into Error, while they approve both, and into Impiety while they deſpiſe both indifferently. Nor is it a difficult thing to ſee the Cauſe of theſe laſt Errors; They proceed from the Connexion of Idea's explain'd in the Eleventh Chapter; nor is it neceſſary to inſiſt any farther upon the Explanation of 'em here.</p>
                     <p>However it ſeems worth our while to ſay ſomething of Chymiſts,
<note place="margin">Of thoſe that make Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and generally of all thoſe that ſpend their time in making Experiments. They are People that Search after Truth; and their Opinions are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally follow'd without any Examination. Therefore their Errors are ſo much the more dangerous, becauſe they are imparted to others with ſo much the more eaſe.</p>
                     <p>'Tis better, without queſtion, to Study Nature than Books. Viſible and ſenſible Experiments are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much more evident Proofs than the Arguments of Men. Nor are they to be blam'd, who, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd by their Profeſſion in the Study of Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60613:131"/>endeavour to improve their Skill by conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Experiments, provided they apply their Labours to the Improvement of the moſt neceſſary Sciences. Therefore Experimental Philoſophy is not to be found fault with, nor they who make it their practiſe, but only their Defects.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is, that they are ſeldom guided, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Experiments by the Light of Reaſon, but by Chance. From whence it comes to paſs that they become but little more Learned or Knowing, after they have ſpent much time and Money.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond is, becauſe they are more Sedulous in Curious and Extraordinary Experiments, than ſuch as are moſt common and familiar. Nevertheleſs the moſt Common Experiments are the moſt Simple; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought firſt of all to apply themſelves to thoſe, before they ſettle to ſuch as are more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and which depend upon a greater number of Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>The third is, becauſe they proſecute thoſe Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that bring in Profit, and neglect thoſe that ſerve to illuminate the Mind.</p>
                     <p>The fourth is, becauſe they do not accurately enough obſerve all the particular Circumſtances of Time, Place and Quality of the Drugs which they make uſe of; though the leaſt of theſe Circumſtances is ſufficient to fruſtrate the Effect which they deſire. For it is to be obſerv'd, that all the Terms of which the Phyſicians make uſe of are Equivocal: For Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Wine, has as many various ſignifications as there are varieties of Soil, different Seaſons, different Manners of making Wine, and different Manners of preſerving it; ſo that in general we may ſay, that there are not two Tuns of Wine altogether alike. Therefore when a Phyſician, in order to the making ſuch an Experiment, ſays, take Wine, no body knows, but very confuſedly, what he means. Therefore there is very great Caution to be us'd in Experiments; nor ought they to attempt Compounded ones, till they know the Reaſon of the more Simple and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:60613:131"/>
                     <p>The fifth ariſes from hence, that too many Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are drawn from one Experiment: Whereas, on the contrary, we want ſeveral Experiments to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one true Concluſion.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the greateſt part of Phyſicians and Chymiſts conſider only the Particular Effects of Nature; they never return to the firſt Notions of Things, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Bodies; Nevertheleſs, 'tis moſt certain, that no Man can clearly and diſtinctly underſtand the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Phenomena of Natural Philoſophy, unleſs he be Maſter of the more General Principles, and unleſs he alſo know ſomething in Metaphyſics. In a word, they often want Courage and Conſtancy; they are terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and tired with the Labour and Expence.

                     <p>The Cauſes of theſe Defects are little Application, and the Properties of the Imagination explain'd in the Tenth and Eleventh Chapter; and becauſe we never judge otherwiſe of the difference and alterations of Bodies, than by the Apprehenſions we have of 'em, as has been ſaid in the Firſt Book.</p>

                     <p>HAving Explain'd the Nature of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Defects to which it is ſubject, and how our own Imagination leads us into Error, there nothing more remains for us to Diſcourſe of in this Second Book, but of the Contagious Communication of Strong Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that is, of the Prevailing Power which ſome Men have to engage others in their Errors.</p>
                     <pb n="220" facs="tcp:60613:133"/>
                     <p>Strong Imaginations are extreamly Contagious; they prevail over thoſe that are weak; they make 'em ſtoop to their own Laws, and imprint upon 'em their own Characters. Therefore, becauſe Men that have particular Idea's, and a Strong and Vigorous Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, moſt commonly exceed the Bounds of Reaſon, there are few more General Cauſes of Error than this pernicious Communication of the Imagination.</p>
                     <p>For the better underſtanding what this Contagion is, and how it is tranſmitted from one to another, we muſt conſider that all Men have need of one another, and that they are made to compoſe, among themſelves, ſeveral Bodies, of which the Parts ſhould have a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Correſpondence one with another; for the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of which Union it is, that God has command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'em to be Charitable one toward another; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Self-Love might by little and little extinguiſh Charity, and by that means diſſolve the Bond of Civil Society, the Almighty judg'd it convenient that Men ſhould be united together by Natural Ties, which might ſubſiſt when Charity fail'd, and which might defend it againſt the Efforts of Self-Love.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Natural Ties which are common to us with Beaſts, conſiſt in a certain Diſpoſition of the Brain, with which all Men are endued, to imitate thoſe with whom they Converſe, to make the ſame Judgments which they do, and to be ſubject to the ſame Paſſions of the Mind to which they are ſubject. And this ſame Diſpoſition uſually unites Men together much more cloſe and firmly than Charity grounded upon Reaſon, which ſort of Charity is very rare.</p>
                     <p>Unleſs a Man be endu'd with this ſame Diſpoſition of the Brain, to partake of our Sentiments and our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he is incapable of his own Nature to unite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with us, and compoſe one Body. He is like thoſe Stones of an irregular form, for which there is no room in a Building, becauſe they cannot be joined to the reſt.</p>

                     <p>It requires a larger Portion of Vertue than Men are aware of, not to break with thoſe that no way ſympathize with our Paſſions, but whoſe Sentiments are in all things contrary to ours. Nor is it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without Reaſon: For when a Man has good cauſe to be Sad or Joyful, 'tis in ſome meaſure an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front not to correſpond with him in his Sentiments. If he be Sad, 'tis not proper to appear before him with a brisk and jolly Air, which argues Gladneſs, and which ſtrongly imprints the Motions of it in his Imagination; for this is to put him out of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which is moſt convenient and pleaſing to him, Sadneſs being the moſt delightful of all the Paſſions to a Man in Miſery.</p>
                     <p>All Men therefore have a certain Diſpoſition of the Brain,
<note place="margin">Two Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſes that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our Inclination to imitate one another.</note> which naturally inclines 'em to be affected after the ſame manner as ſome of thoſe with whom they Converſe. Now there are two Principal Cauſes that foment and increaſe this Diſpoſition, the firſt is in the Soul, the ſecond in the Body: The firſt conſiſts in the Natural Propenſity of Men to Grandeur and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This Propenſity it is, which imperceptibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites us to imitate Perſons of Quality, in their manner of Speaking, Walking, Dreſs, and Outward Air. This is the Original of New Modes, of the Inſtability of living Languages, and of certain general Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Manners. This is the chief Origine of all Extravagant and Fantaſtick Novelties, which are not ſupported by Reaſon, but Human Fancy and Pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The other Cauſe which much incline to imitate others, and which we ought chiefly to Diſcourſe of here, conſiſts in a certain Impreſſion which Perſons of a Strong Imagination make upon Feeble Minds, and upon Tender and Delicate Brains.
<note place="margin">What a Strong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</note> I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by a Strong and Vigorous Imagination that Conſtitution of the Brain which makes it capable of Traces extreamly deep, and fill the Receptacle of the Mind in ſuch a manner, that it cannot attend to other things than ſuch as the Images themſelves repreſent to it.</p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:60613:134"/>
                     <p>There are two ſorts of Perſons who have a Strong Imagination in this Senſe.
<note place="margin">Two ſorts of it.</note> The firſt receive theſe deep Traces by an Unvoluntary and Irregular Impreſſion of the Animal Spirits; and the others, of whom we intend principally to Diſcourſe here, receive 'em from a certain Diſpoſition which is obſerv'd in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Brains.</p>
                     <p>'Tis viſible that the firſt are abſolute Mad Men, ſeeing they are conſtrain'd by the Natural Connexion which is between their Idea's and their Traces, to think upon things not thought of by others with whom they Converſe; which renders 'em incapable of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the purpoſe, and anſwering directly to Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are ask'd 'em.</p>
                     <p>There are an infinite number of this ſort of People who only differ in the more or the leſs; and it may be ſaid, that all ſuch as are agitated with ſome violent Paſſion are of their number, ſince at the time of their Emotion, the Animal Spirits ſo forcibly imprint the Traces and Images of their Paſſion, that they are incapable of thinking upon any thing elſe.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis to be obſerv'd, that all theſe ſort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are not capable of corrupting the Imagination of any Man, let his Mind be never ſo weak, and his Brain never ſo ſoft and delicate; and this for two Reaſons. The firſt, Becauſe they are not able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer conformably to the Idea's of others, they can perſwade 'em to nothing; And ſecondly, Becauſe the Diſturbance of their Mind being altogether manifeſt, whatever they ſay is hearken'd to with contempt.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, 'tis true that Paſſionate Perſons put us into Paſſions, and make Impreſſions in our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion like thoſe with which they themſelves are affected. But in regard their Tranſports are manifeſtly viſible, we reſiſt thoſe Impreſſions, and get rid of 'em ſoon after. They rub out of themſelves, when they are not fomented by the Cauſe that produc'd 'em, that is to ſay, when the Tranſported Perſons are departed out of our preſence, and when the ſenſible ſight of the Characters, which Paſſion form'd in the Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, produces no farther Alteration in the Fibres of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:60613:134"/>our Brain, nor any Agitation in our Animal Spirits.</p>
                     <p>I only Examine here that ſort of Strong and Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Imagination which conſiſts in a Diſpoſition of the Brain proper to receive very deep Traces of more feeble and leſs active Objects.</p>
                     <p>'Tis no defect, to have a Brain proper for a Strong Imagination of Things, and for the Reception of the moſt diſtinct and lively Images of the moſt inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Objects, provided that the Mind be always Miſtreſs of the Imagination, that theſe Images be imprinted by her Orders, and that they may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd when ſhe pleaſes; for hence ariſes ſagacity and ſtrength of Wit. But when the Imagination over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules the Soul, and theſe Traces form themſelves by the Diſpoſition of the Brain, and by the Activity of the Objects and Spirits, without expecting the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Will, this is a moſt Miſchievous Vice, and a kind of Madneſs. We ſhall therefore endeavour to ſet forth the Character of thoſe who have a Strong Imagination of this ſort.</p>
                     <p>To that purpoſe it behoves us to remember that the Receptacle of the Mind is confin'd to narrow limits. 2. That it is fill'd with no Object more eaſily than with the Senſations of the Mind, and generally with the Perceptions of Objects that affect us very much. 3. That the deep Traces of the Brain are always ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Senſations, or other Perceptions that vigorouſly affect us. For thereby 'tis eaſie to know the Genuine Characters of their Wit who have a Strong Imagination.</p>
                     <p>The firſt is,
<note place="margin">Two conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in thoſe who have a Strong Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</note> that theſe Perſons are not capable of giving a ſound Judgment of things that are a little difficult and perplext, becauſe the Receptacle of the Mind being fill'd with Idea's that are by Nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd with thoſe very deep Traces, they have not the Liberty to think of ſeveral things at the ſame time. But in Compound Queſtions, 'tis requiſite that the Mind ſhould ſurvey with one quick and ſuddain mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Idea's of many things, and diſcover, at one ſingle view, the Correſpondencies and Connexions that
<pb facs="tcp:60613:135"/>are neceſſary for the reſolving of thoſe Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>All Men know by their own Experience, that they are not capable of applying themſelves to the Search of any Truth, at ſuch time as they are afflicted with any violent Pain, becauſe then, there are in the Brain thoſe deep Traces which take up the Capacity of the Mind. Thus, thoſe Perſons of whom we ſpeak, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving deeper Traces of the ſame Objects, (as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) they cannot have ſo great an Extenſion of Mind, nor comprehend ſo many things together as the others. The firſt Defect of theſe Perſons is to have a narrow Wit, and how much the narrower it is, ſo much the deeper Traces their Brain receives of inconſiderable Objects.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Defect is, they are Viſionaries, yet after a Delicate Manner, and difficult to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd. The Vulgar ſort of Men believe 'em not to be ſuch; there are none but juſt and clear Wits that perceive their Viſions, and the Deviations of their Imagination.</p>
                     <p>Now that we may be able to conceive the Original of this Defect, 'tis neceſſary to remember what we have ſaid at the beginning of the ſecond Book: That as to thoſe things which are acted in the Brain, the Senſes and Imagination differ only in the <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs;</hi> that it is by reaſon of the largeneſs and deepneſs of the Traces, that the Mind becomes ſenſible of Objects; that it judges of 'em as preſent, and capable of affecting it, and ſo near it as to make it ſenſible of Pain and Pleaſure. For when the Traces of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject are ſmall, the Soul imagines only that ſame Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; it does not judge it to be preſent, nor does it look upon it to be very great or very conſiderable; but as the Traces become deeper and greater, the Mind alſo judges that the Object becomes greater and more conſiderable, approaches nearer to us, and laſtly is more apt to affect and injure us.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Viſionaries of whom we here diſcourſe, are not arriv'd to that Exceſs of Folly, to believe they ſee preſent before their Eyes thoſe Objects which are Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. The Traces of their Brain are not yet deep
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:60613:135"/>enough; they are but half Mad; were they abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, 'twere in vain for us to talk of 'em here. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all Men being ſenſible of their Errors, they would not ſuffer themſelves to be deluded by 'em. They are not Viſionaries in reſpect of the Senſes, but only in reference to the Imagination. Madmen are Viſionaries in reference to the Senſes, becauſe they ſee not Things as they are, and many times believe they ſee thoſe Things which are not. However 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Viſionaries in reference to the Senſes, and in reference to the Imagination, differ only in the <hi>more</hi> and <hi>leſs;</hi> neither is the Paſſing from one Condition to the other very difficult. Whence it comes to paſs, that the Diſtemper of Mind in the latter, ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by comparing it with the Diſtemper of the former, which is more manifeſt, and more ſtrongly affects the Mind; ſince in things which differ no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than in the <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs,</hi> thoſe things that leſs ſenſibly affect us are always to be explain'd by thoſe things that affect us more vehemently.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Defect of thoſe who have a ſtrong and vigorous Imagination, is, that they are Viſionaries as to the Imagination, or barely Viſionaries; for we call thoſe Madmen, that are Viſionaries in reference to the Senſes. And thus we have enumerated the Vices of Viſionary or Fantaſtick Wits.</p>
                     <p>Theſe People exceed their Bounds in every thing; they extol mean and abject things; they magnifie ſmall things, and bring remote things near to the ſight. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appears to 'em what it really is. They admire every thing; they exclaim againſt every thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diſcretion. If they are naturally diſpos'd to be fearful; I mean, if their Animal Spirits are in ſmall quantity, without vigor, without motion, they are afraid of every thing, they tremble at the ſhaking of a Leaf. But if they abound in Blood and Spirits, which is moſt uſual, they feed themſelves with vain Hopes, and give themſelves up to their Imagination which is fruitful in Idea's, and according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, they build Caſtles in the Air, with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary joy and ſatisfaction. They are vehement in their

When they have a fancy to be accounted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Wits, and to ſet up for Authors, (for there are Authors of all ſorts, as well Viſionaries as others;) What Extravagancies, what Deliriums, what Ravings are they not guilty of! They never imitate Nature, every thing is affected, forced, and rapturous; they rather Skip and Leap than Walk, they ſpeak in Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, they utter nothing but Figures and Hyperboles. If they addict themſelves to Godlineſs, and to follow it according to their own Fancies, they put on a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Judaiſm and Phariſaic Hypocriſie; their Minds are altogether intent upon the outſide of things, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ceremonies, and performances of no moment: They become ſcrupulous, fearful, and ſuperſtitious. If you will believe them, every thing belongs to Faith, and every thing is Eſſential, except what really belongs to Faith, and what is truly Eſſential. For many times their Minds being taken up with Duties of little moment, they neglect the more uſeful and more important Precepts of the Goſpel, in reference to Juſtice, Mercy, and Faith. What needs any more? They that deſire to be convinc'd of theſe Defects, and many others, need only to conſider what paſſes in their daily Converſations.</p>
                     <p>But they that have a Strong and Vigorous Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are endu'd with other Qualities, which 'tis very neceſſary for us to explain in this Place. We have only ſpoken hitherto of their Defects, we are now to Diſcourſe of their Vertues and Prerogatives; among which they have one that principally regards our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for by means of that Prerogative they rule over the Minds of the Vulgar, obtrude their Idea's upon 'em, and communicate to 'em all thoſe falſe Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with which they are affected.</p>
                     <p>This Prerogative conſiſts in a ſtrong and vigorous manner of expreſſing themſelves,
<note place="margin">That they who have a ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>, rather by outward ſhew, and ſenſible
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60613:137"/>Impreſſion, than by the force of Reaſon. For the Brains of thoſe who excel in Strength of Imagination, admitting deep Traces of the Subjects which they imagine, as we have ſaid before, thoſe Traces for the moſt part are not imprinted without a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of the Animal Spirits, which diſpoſe the whole Body after a quick and lively manner to expreſs the Cogitations of the Mind. Thus the Air of their Face, the Tone of their Voice, and Elegancy of Speech en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening their Expreſſions, they gain Attention of their Spectators and Hearers, and prepare 'em to receive Mechanically the Impreſſion of the Image that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently moves 'em. For in ſhort, thoſe things that are deeply infus'd into our Mind, are uſually as deeply infus'd by us into the Minds of others. He that is mov'd by a vehement Paſſion, ſtill moves others with the ſame Paſſion; and though his Rhetoric be often Irregular, yet for all that, 'tis very perſwaſive: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the External Air and Geſture, as being moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, acts more vigorouſly upon the Imagination of Men, than the moſt ſolid Arguments, that are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dately pronounced, becauſe thoſe Ratiocinations nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther flatter the Senſes, nor ſtrike the Imagination.</p>
                     <p>Perſons then, who excel in Imagination, have the advantage to pleaſe, to affect, and perſwade, becauſe they form the moſt lively and ſenſible Images of their thoughts. But there are other Cauſes that contribute to their eaſie gaining upon the Mind: For they never Diſcourſe but upon eaſie Subjects, and ſuch as are within the reach of Vulgar Apprehenſions: They never make uſe of other Expreſſions and Terms than ſuch as only excite the Confus'd Notions of the Senſes, which always moſt vehemently affect us: They never talk of Sublime and Difficult Matters but after a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling manner, and by way of Common Places: For they dare not venture themſelves to dive into Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſtick cloſe to Principles; whither it be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not underſtand thoſe Matters; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are afraid leſt they ſhould for want of Terms intangle themſelves, and tire the Minds of thoſe that are not accuſtom'd to a ſerious Attention.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THere are frequent Examples of this Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Imagination in Children, in reſpect of their Parents, more eſpecially in Girles, in reſpect of their Mothers; in Men Servants in reſpect of their Maſters; and Maid Servants in reſpect of their Miſtreſſes; in Scholers in reſpect of their School-maſters; Courtiers in reſpect of their Princes, and generally in all Inferiors in reſpect of their Superiors. Provided that Parents, Maſters, and other Superiors be endued with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Strong Imagination; otherwiſe the Weak Imagination of Parents or Maſters will make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Impreſſion in Children or Servants.</p>
                     <p>The Effects of this Communication are alſo to be obſerv'd in Perſons of Equal Conditions; but that is not ſo uſual; becauſe there is not that Veneration among them, which diſpoſes the Mind in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as to admit the Impreſſion of Strong Imaginations without any Examination. Laſtly, theſe Effects are to be met with in Superiors in reſpect of their Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors: For many times Inferiors are endu'd with an
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60613:138"/>Imagination ſo lively and imperious, that they bend the Minds of their Maſters and Superiors which way they pleaſe themſelves.</p>
                     <p>It will be an eaſie thing to apprehend how Fathers and Mothers make very ſtrong Impreſſions upon the Imaginations of their Children, if we conſider, that theſe Natural Diſpoſitions of our Brain, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to imitate thoſe with whom we Converſe, and to be affected with the ſame Sentiments and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are far ſtronger in Children, in reſpect of their Parents, than in other Men: For which ſeveral Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be given; and the firſt is, becauſe they are of the ſame Blood: For as Parents frequently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their Children a Diſpoſition to certain Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary Diſtempers, as the Gout, the Stone, Madneſs, and generally all thoſe Diſeaſes which do not come by accident, or from ſome extraordinary Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Humours, as Fevers, Agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it is viſible, that as thoſe Diſeaſes cannot be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, ſo they imprint the Diſpoſitions of their own upon the Brains of their Children, and bend their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations in ſuch a manner, as to render 'em capable of the ſame Sentiments with themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Reaſon is, becauſe that Children have very little Familiarity with other Men, who might ſometimes elſe impreſs other Traces in their Brains, and in ſome meaſure fruſtrate the continual Effort of Paternal Impreſſions. For as a Man that never ſtirr'd out of his own Country uſually imagines the Manners and Cuſtoms of Foreign Nations to be altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon, ſo a Child that never ſtirr'd out of his Fathers Houſe, imagines the Sentiments of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and their manner of living to be the Standard of Univerſal Reaſon; or, rather he does not believe there are any other Principles of Reaſon or Vertue, than what he has imbib'd from his Parents: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believes whatever he hears his Parents ſay, and conforms himſelf in whatever they do.</p>
                     <p>But this Imagination of Parents is ſo ſtrong, that it not only acts upon the Imagination of Children, but alſo upon other parts of the Body. A Son imitates
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60613:139"/>the Gate, the Speech, and Geſtures of his Father. A Daughter imitates the Dreſs, the Pace, and Voice of her Mother: If the Mother Liſps, the Daughter Liſps; if the Mother have an ill Habit of holding her Head awry, the Daughter does ſo too. Laſtly, Children imitate their Parents in every thing, in their Defects and their ill Geſtures, in their Errors and their Vices.</p>
                     <p>There are ſeveral other Cauſes which augment the Effect of this Impreſſion: Of which the chiefeſt are the Authority of Parents, the Dependency of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the mutual Affection both of the one and the other. But theſe Cauſes are common to Courtiers, and Servants, and generally to all Inferiors as well as to Children. We ſhall now Explain the Matter by the Example of Courtiers.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome People who judge of what they ſee, by what is conſpicuous before their Eyes; as of Sublimneſs, Power, and Capacity of Mind, which lie conceal'd from their Knowledge, by that Nobility, thoſe Dignities, and that Wealth which is known to 'em. They frequently meaſure one by the other. And our dependance upon Great Men ſo much above us, our deſire to participate of their Grandeur, and the vaſt Splendour that environs 'em, incline us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to pay Divine Honours to Mortal Men, if it may be lawful for me to ſay ſo. For if God confer Authority upon Princes, Men aſcribe Infallibility to 'em; an Infallibility ſo univerſal as not to be circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd within any bounds in any thing, or upon any occafion, nor tied to any Ceremonies. Great Men know all things naturally: Though they decide Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of which they have no knowledge, yet they have always Reaſon on their ſide. He that dares ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to Examine what they ſay, is ignorant, and knows nothing; He that raiſes any doubts, derogates from that Veneration which is due to 'em; He that condemns 'em, is guilty of Rebellion; or at leaſt is a Sott, a Madman, and fit for nothing but to be made a Laughing Stock to all the World.</p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:60613:139"/>
                     <p>But if Great Men vouchſafe us their Favours; then, if we do not approve all their Sayings, we are not only Obſtinate, Headſtrong, and Rebellious, but Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful and Perfidious; this is a fault beyond repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that renders us unworthy of their Favours, which is the Reaſon that Courtiers, and by a neceſſary Conſequence, almoſt all other People without any Conſideration, ſwear to the Sentiments of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, and frequently ſurrender themſelves, even in Matters of Religion, to their Humours and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricio's.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> furniſh us with too many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of theſe Irregular Submiſſions to the Impious Commands of their Princes. The Hiſtories of later Ages are full of 'em. Nor were there wanting ſome Perſons well advanced in years, who chang'd their Religion 4 or 5 times in compliance with the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of their Princes in that Particular.</p>
                     <p>The Revolutions of Religion in <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> may ſerve us for a Proof of the Dominion which ſome Minds have over others. But there were alſo other very conſiderable Cauſes of theſe Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And theſe ſurprizing Changes are ſo many Proofs of the Contagious Communication of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. But theſe Proofs are too general and great, they rather aſtoniſh and dazle the Mind, than illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate it, becauſe there are too many Cauſes that concur to produce theſe great Events.</p>
                     <p>If Courtiers and other Men many times abandon Truths that are Eſſential, and not to be forſaken, but with the hazard of Eternity, 'tis viſible that they will venture leſs to uphold abſtracted Truths, leſs certain and of little uſe. If the Religion of the Prince be the Religion of his Subjects, the Reaſon alſo of the Prince muſt be the Reaſon likewiſe of his Subjects. And ſo the Sentiments of the Prince, will be always <hi>Alamode.</hi> His Pleaſures, his Paſſions, his Words, his Habit, and generally all his Actions, will be imitated. For the Prince is himſelf the Eſſential Rule of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And it rarely happens that he does any thing but what is abſolutely modiſh. Now as all the Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60613:140"/>of the Mode are no more than ſo many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ornaments and Graces, 'tis no wonder that Princes act ſo ſtrongly upon the Imagination of other Men.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>Alexander</hi> hangs his Head on one ſide, all his Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers do the ſame. If <hi>Dionyſius</hi> the Tyrant applies himſelf to Geometry, upon the arrival of <hi>Plato</hi> at <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> Geometry preſently becomes Alamode, and the Kings Palace, ſays <hi>Plutarch,</hi> is immediately co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd with a Miſt of Duſt, through the great number of thoſe that draw Figures upon the Ground. But ſo ſoon as <hi>Plato</hi> is offended with the Prince, and that the Prince indulging his Pleaſures, begins to be weary of Geometry, the Courtiers alſo lay it quite aſide. A Man would think,
<note place="margin">In Moral Works; How to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh a Flatterer from a Friend.</note> (continues the ſame Author) that they were inchanted, and that ſome <hi>Circe</hi> had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd 'em into other Men: They paſs from their Love of Philoſophy, to their Inclination to Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, which before they abhorr'd. Thus 'tis in the Power of Princes to change Vertues into Vices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are able to change all Idea's with a Word only; There needs no more than the leaſt Nodd of their Heads, or the leaſt motion of their Bodies, their Eyes, or their Lips, to make Knowledge and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſs for contemptible Pedantry; Raſhneſs, Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs, and Cruelty, for greatneſs of Courage; and Impiety and Libertiniſm for Strength and Liberty of Wit.</p>
                     <p>But in this, as well as in other things, I would have it preſuppos'd, that Princes excell in Strength and Vigor of Imagination: For had they an Imagination Weak and Languiſhing, they could never enliven 'em with that Turn, and Energie, that invincibly ſubdues and vanquiſhes feeble Minds.</p>
                     <p>If the force of Imagination alone, without the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of Reaſon, be able to produce ſuch wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Effects, there is nothing ſo Fantaſtick or Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant which is not ſufficiently powerful to perſwade, let it be only ſupported by ſome Appearance of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. I thus prove it by Examples.</p>
                     <p>An Ancient Author reports,
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Diodorus Siculus Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blioth. Hiſt, l.</hi> 3.</note> that in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> the Courtiers made themſelves Lame, and Deformed,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60613:140"/>nay, that they even diſmember'd, and laid violent hands upon themſelves, that they might reſemble their Princes: They look'd upon it as Ignominious to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with two Eyes, or to walk upright in the Train of a Prince that was blind of one Eye, or halted of one Leg; in like manner, they durſt not appear at Court but with a little indented Hat, with White Buskins, and Gilt Spurs: That Faſhion of the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> was very Fantaſtical and Inconvenient, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs it was the Mode: They follow'd it with a World of Joy, and defying the Pain which they were to endure, minded only the Honour which they did themſelves, in ſhewing their Generoſity and Affection for their King. Laſtly, this Falſe Argument of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſupporting the Extravagance of the Faſhion, has made it paſs into a Cuſtom and a Law that has been a long time obſerv'd.</p>
                     <p>The Relations of thoſe who have Travell'd into the Eaſt, inform us that this Cuſtom is ſtill obſerv'd in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Countreys: But what neceſſity of twice croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Line to fetch from thence the Religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of unreaſonable Laws and Cuſtoms, or to find out People that follow inconvenient and Fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Modes; we need not go any farther than <hi>France;</hi> For whereſoever Men are indulgent to their Paſſions, wherever the Imagination is Miſtreſs of Reaſon, there is alſo a prodigious Fantaſticalneſs and Inconſtancy of Manners: What think you of our Women, that dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt bitter Froſts and Snow in Winter, diſplay their Naked Breaſts, but in the Exceſſive Heats of Summer they hide their Necks and Boſoms, and go ſo ſtreight Lac'd that they can hardly Breath? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if by that Cuſtom they ſuffer not ſo much Pain as the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> they ought at leaſt to be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd: The Pain is not ſo great, but their Reaſon for enduring it is not ſo apparent, and there is at leaſt an equal Fantaſticalneſs. An <hi>Ethiopian</hi> may alledge, that 'tis out of Generoſity that he digs out one of his Eyes; but what can a Chriſtian Lady ſay for her ſelf, that makes a vaunting ſhew of that which Nature and Religion oblige her to conceal? Only that 'tis the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60613:141"/>Mode, and nothing more. But this Mode is Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtick, Inconvenient, Undecent, and Unworthy the Manners of a Chriſtian. It has no other Original, but a Reaſon manifeſtly depraved, and a ſecret Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Heart; 'tis ſcandalous to obſerve it; 'tis openly to ſide with the Irregularities of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination againſt Reaſon; to revolt from Purity to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, from the Spirit of God to the Spirit of the World: In a Word, 'tis a violation of the Laws of Reaſon and the Goſpel, to follow this Mode. 'Tis no matter,— 'tis the Mode,— that is to ſay a Law more Sacred and Inviolable than that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wrote upon the Tables of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grav'd by his Holy Spirit in the Hearts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                     <p>In truth, I know not whether the French have any Reaſon to Laugh at the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> and Savages: 'Tis true that the firſt time a Man ſhould happen to ſee a Lame and One-Eyed Prince, attended by a Company of Cripples and Single-Eyed Perſons, 'twould be a hard matter to abſtain from Laughter: However time would familiarize the Sight, and the greatneſs of their Courage and Friendſhip would be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd, than the weakneſs of their Judgment would be derided: But 'tis not the ſame thing with the Modes of <hi>France;</hi> their Fantaſticalneſs is not ſupported by any Probable Reaſon; ſo that if they are not ſo troubleſome, they are ſtill the more Ridiculous. In a word, they wear the Character of a moſt Corrupted Age, wherein there is nothing ſufficiently powerful to moderate the Irregularity of the Imagination.</p>
                     <p>What we have ſaid of Courtiers is to be underſtood of the greateſt part of Men Servants in reference to their Maſters, and Maid Servants in reference to their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, and that we may not ſpend too much time, I would have it to be underſtood of all Superiors; but chiefly of Children in reference to their Parents: becauſe Children are under a particular Dependency upon their Parents becauſe their Parents have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Love and Tenderneſs for 'em, which other
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60613:141"/>Perſons have not; Laſtly, becauſe Children are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by Reaſon to that Submiſſion and Obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that many times exceed the Bounds of Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not always neceſſary, that other Men ſhould have Authority over us, or that we ſhould depend in ſome meaſure upon 'em, to enable 'em to work upon the Imagination: For the only power of the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſometimes ſufficient for that purpoſe, ſeeing it frequently falls out, that Perſons, ſuch as are unknown, of no Reputation, and for whom we are not prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with any Eſteem, are endu'd with ſuch a force of Imagination, and by Conſequence ſo lively and moving, that they perſwade us we neither know which way, nor how. 'Tis true, it ſeems very ſtrange, but there is nothing ſo common.</p>
                     <p>Now this Imaginary Perſuaſion can only come from the power of a Viſionary Perſon, who ſpeaks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding what he ſays, and by that means inclines the Minds of thoſe that hearken to him to believe ſtrongly without knowing what they believe: For moſt Men are ſo ſtupified with the Effort of a Dazling Expreſſion, that they judge as their Paſſion leads 'em, of thoſe things which they underſtand but very confuſedly. And I deſire the Readers of this Treatiſe to obſerve ſuch Examples as they meet with in their daily Converſations, and to revolve in their Minds what paſſes upon thoſe Occaſions; for I make no queſtion but they will find more Benefit by it than they can imagine.</p>
                     <p>But it is farther to be obſerved, that there are two things that wonderfully contribute to the Operations of the Forcible Imagination of others over us: The firſt is an Air of Piety and Gravity; The ſecond, an Air of Libertiniſm and Confidence. For according to our Propenſity either to Devotion or Licentiouſneſs, Perſons that ſpeak with a Grave and Pious Air, or an Air of Confidence, and Libertiniſm work very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently upon us.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true, that of theſe there are ſome more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous than others. However have a care of being deluded by the outward ſhews either of the one or
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60613:142"/>the other; or of ſubmitting to any thing but the force of ſolid Arguments, To this may be utter'd after a Grave and Modeſt manner, and Impiety and Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy may be cover'd with the Cloak of Piety. It behoves us to Examine according to the Precept of St. <hi>John, whether the Spirits are of God or no,</hi> and not confide in every Spirit. The Devils ſometimes tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves into Angels of Light. Nor are there wanting ſome Perſons, who having, as it were, a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Air of Piety, are look'd upon as Men endu'd with true Devotion, and under that Mask are ſo dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as to pronounce Men free and exempted from their Eſſential Obligations, and even from the Love of God and their Neighbours, on purpoſe to enſlave 'em to ſome Phariſaical Practice or Ceremony.</p>
                     <p>But the Imaginations, whoſe Impreſſion and Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we ought moſt chiefly to avoid, are thoſe of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons in the World who affect the Title of Great Wits, which they acquire with little difficulty: For now there needs no more than with a certain Air of Impudence to deny Original Sin, the Immortality of the Soul, or to ſcoff at ſome receiv'd Opinion of the Church, to acquire the Rare Title of a Great Wit among the Common ſort of Men.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſlender Wits are uſually full of Fire, and I know not by what Air of Licenſe and Boldneſs they impiouſly impoſe upon other Mens Minds, and incline weak Imaginations to ſurrender to Lively and Plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Words, but ſuch as ſignifie nothing to thoſe which duely weigh and conſider 'em. They are very happy in their Expreſſions, though very unfortunate in their Reaſons. But becauſe even Men, how reaſonable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, rather chooſe to be affected with the ſenſible Pleaſure of Geſture and Expreſſions, than to tire themſelves with the difficult Examination of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; therefore 'tis viſible that thoſe Wits are preferr'd to others, and by that means communicate their Errors and Malignity through the Power which they have over the Imaginations of other Men.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>II. <hi>Of</hi> Tertullian.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ONE of the greateſt and moſt Remarkable Proofs of the Power which ſome Imaginations have over others, is the Power that certain Authors have to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, though they bring no Reaſons for what they ſay. For Example, <hi>Tertullian, Seneca, Montaigne,</hi> and ſome others give a Turn to their Words, that have ſo many Charms, and ſuch a Luſtre as dazles the Minds of moſt People, though in their Writings the Imaginations of thoſe Authors be but imperfectly painted and ſhadow'd. Their Words, though they want Life, have a greater Efficacy in 'em, than the Reaſons of ſome Perſons: They enter, they penetrate, and command the Mind after ſo imperious a manner, that they force it to a blind Obedience, and tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally compel it to an unthought of Submiſſion. The Mind is willing to believe, but knows not what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; for when it fain would know what it deſires to believe, and approaches near thoſe Phantomes, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh what they are, they vaniſh into Air with all their Pomp and Splendour.</p>
                     <p>Though the Writings of the Authors above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd are very proper to demonſtrate the Force of Imagination, and though I propoſe 'em for Example ſake, yet do I not go about to condemn 'em in all things: There are ſome certain Beauties in 'em that I cannot but applaud; nor is it my deſign to inveigh againſt the Univerſal Approbation of many Ages. I proteſt that I have a high Reſpect for ſome of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s Works; more eſpecially for his <hi>Apology againſt the Gentiles,</hi> and his Book of <hi>Preſcriptions againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi> I alſo admire <hi>Seneca</hi> in ſome parts of his
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60613:143"/>Writings; but as for <hi>Montaigne</hi>'s whole Book, I very little value it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> was in truth a Man of profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but he had a better Memory than Judgment; he had more of Penetration and Extent of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than of Wit: Nor can it be denied but that he was a Viſionary in that ſenſe which I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, and that he was infected with all thoſe Vices which I have attributed to Viſionary Wits. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which he had for <hi>Montanus</hi> and his Propheteſſes, is an undeniable Proof of the Weakneſs of his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. That Heat, thoſe Tranſports, thoſe Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſms of his upon Petty Subjects, palpably demonſtrate the Diſorder of his Imagination. How many irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Ceremonies are there in his <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> and his <hi>Figures?</hi> How many Pompous and Magnificent Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, that only force Perſuaſion and Proof by aſtoniſhing and dazling the Mind?</p>
                     <p>Of what uſe, for Example, is it to that Author, when he would juſtifie himſelf for having put on the Philoſopher's Gown, and not the Garment he was wont to wear, to tell us, that the Gown had formerly been in faſhion at <hi>Carthage?</hi> Would it be a ſufficient Excuſe for a Man now to wear a Cap and a Ruff, becauſe our Fore-fathers made uſe of them? And would it look decent for the Women in this Age to wear Fardingales and French Hoods, unleſs it were in Carnaval time, when they had a mind to diſguiſe themſelves?</p>
                     <p>What could he infer from thoſe Pompous and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Deſcriptions of the Revolutions and Caſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities that happen in the World, or what could they contribute to his Juſtification? The Moon varies in her Aſpects; the Year in the Seaſons of it; the Fields look of another Hue in the Winter, than in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. There happen Inundations that drown whole Provinces, and Earthquakes that ſwallow up entire Cities. New Cities are built, new Colonies ſettled; we have heard of Inundations of People that have over-run and ſubdu'd Kingdoms: in a Word, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is ſubject to change. Therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> lays
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60613:143"/>aſide his common Garment to put on his Gown. What, I would fain know, have all thoſe various Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and others without number which he anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly enquires into, and deſcribes with forc'd, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and wreſted Expreſſions, to do with his Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? The Peacock cannot move his Foot, but he changes colour; the Serpent creeping through ſome narrow Hole ſtrips off his Skin and renews his Age; therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> had reaſon to change his Habit. Who, in cold Blood, and with a Sedate Mind, but would draw theſe Concluſions; or, who would not laugh at the Author himſelf, to hear him make ſuch Inferences; Did he not trouble and dizzy the Brains of his Reader with the noiſe of his Rhetorick?</p>
                     <p>Almoſt all the reſt of his Little Book <hi>De Pallio,</hi> is full of Reaſons as remote from his Subject, as Theſe, which certainly could prove nothing at all, if the Mind did not ſuffer it ſelf to be ſtupified; but 'tis to no purpoſe to ſtay any longer upon theſe Things. 'Tis ſufficient to ſay thus much farther only, that if Exactneſs of Mind, as alſo Perſpicuity and Clearneſs in Words ought always to appear in every thing we Write, ſeeing we Write to no other end but to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; If this, I ſay, be true, then is <hi>Tertullian</hi> never to be excus'd, who, by the Confeſſion of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius</hi> himſelf, the greateſt Critick of this Age, did all he could to render himſelf obſcure,

                     <p>
                        <hi>SEneca</hi>'s Imagination is ſometimes no better regulated than that of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> His Impetuous Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions frequently hurry him into Countreys unknown to him, where nevertheleſs he Travels with the ſame aſſurance, as if he had known where he was, and whither he was going. Provided he make large Steps, and adorn his Periods with Figures and juſt Caden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he thinks he has gone a great way: But he is like your Dauncers, who always end at the ſame place where they began.</p>
                     <p>It behoves us to diſtinguiſh rightly between the Force ond Beauty of Words, and the Force and Beauty of Reaſons. 'Tis true there appears much of Efficacy and Elegancy in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Words, but there is little of Strength or Clearneſs in his Reaſons. By the Strength of his Imagination he gives ſuch a certain Turn to his Words, as to render 'em moving, ſtirring, and perſuaſive by Impreſſion, but he does not afford 'em that perſpicuity, nor that pure Light, whereby
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60613:144"/>the Mind may be enlighten'd and perſuaded by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. He convinces becauſe he moves, and pleaſes; but I can hardly believe that they are convinc'd by him that read him ſedately, and who being aware of ſurprizal, never yield but when vanquiſh'd by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity, and demonſtrations of Reaſon. In a word, provided he ſpeaks and ſpeaks well, he is not very ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous what he ſays; as if a Man could ſpeak well, yet not know what he ſaid. And thus he convinces by a blind perſuaſion, which they who admit, do not well apprehend after what manner they came to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; as if the Mind ought to ſuffer it ſelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, unleſs it diſtinctly underſtand the Matter after due Examination.</p>
                     <p>What is more Pompous and Magnificent than his Idea of a Wiſe Man, yet at the Bottom, what more Vain and Imaginary? His Portraiture of <hi>Cato</hi> is too Illuſtrious to be accounted Genuine: They are Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations and Paintings that only impoſe upon ſuch as never ſtudy or know the Nature of Man. <hi>Cato</hi> was a Man ſubject to all the Miſeries that befall Mankind; and therefore to ſay he was invulnerable was an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Miſtake: They that ſtrike him, hurt him.

                     <p>Thus you ſee how <hi>Seneca</hi>'s ſtrong Imagination pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails over his weak Reaſon.

Can a Rational Man ever be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd in himſelf, that his Pain never affects or hurts him? But wherefore does he force <hi>Cato</hi> upon us?
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60613:146"/>For certainly let him attribute as much fortitude and wiſdom to him as he pleaſes, he never arrived at that height as to endure without any commotion; I will not ſay, the hainous Injuries of Men falling upon him, Beating and Robbing him, but the very Sting of a Flie. What can there be more weak againſt ſuch ſtrong and convincing Proofs, as thoſe of our own Experience, than this Egregious Reaſon of <hi>Seneca's?</hi> and yet 'tis one of his Principal Proofs.</p>

He would have it believ'd that he was above thoſe that ſtruck him: His Patience was nothing but Pride and Inſolency: It was injurious to thoſe that affronted: For by that ſame Stoical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience did <hi>Cato</hi> ſhew, that he look'd upon his Enemies as Beaſts, that are not worth the anger of a Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and therefore he takes no notice of 'em.

But how delightfully does this ſame Madneſs flatter the Vanity of Man, who always refuſes to ſubmit and debaſe himſelf? And how dangerous is it, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for Chriſtians, to imbibe the Doctrine of a Maſter ſo Indiſcreet and void of Judgment as <hi>Seneca;</hi> but whoſe Imagination is ſo ſtrong, ſo vigorous, and ſo impetuous, that it dazles, and like a Torrent hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries along with it People of weak Underſtanding, and ſuch as are prone to the Flatteries of Pleaſure and Concupiſcence.</p>

                     <p>Rather let Chriſtians learn from their Maſter, that the Wicked are they who are able to hurt 'em, and that Good Men are ſometimes liable to the Injuries of the Impious by the permiſſion of Providence. When one of the Officers belonging to the High-Prieſt ſmote <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon the Face, He, the Wiſeſt of all the Wiſeſt among Chriſtians, infinitely Wiſe, and likewiſe as Powerful as he is Wiſe, does not deny but that he was injur'd by the Officer; however he was not angry; he does not, as <hi>Cato</hi> did, revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he pardons, as one that had ſuffer'd a real Injury; He could have reveng'd himſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd his Enemies; bu the ſuffer'd with an humble and modeſt Patience, which was no way injurious to any body; no, not to the Miſcreant that did him the Miſchief. <hi>Cato</hi> on the other ſide, neither being able, nor daring to take a real Revenge for the Injury he had receiv'd, feigns at leaſt an Imaginary Vengeance that flatters his own Vanity and Pride; he raiſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his own mind above the Clouds; from thence he beholds poor Mortals as ſmall as Flies, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns 'em as Infects uncapable of hurting him, and unworthy of his Anger.

But though Men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look'd upon as Madmen who believe themſelves to be transform'd into Cocks or Kings, yet are they not always number'd among the Frantick Viſionaries, who believe that their Vertue reſembles 'em to God, and Independent from all Authority and Command,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60613:147"/>The Reaſon of it is, that it is not enough to have Raving Thoughts to be counted a Madman; they muſt be accounted Phrentick and Ridiculous by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: For Madmen never paſs for what they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong ſuch as reſemble themſelves, but only among Men of Senſe and Wiſdom, as Wiſe-men are never look'd upon to be ſuch by thoſe that are Mad: Men then acknowledge thoſe to be Fools who conceit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be turn'd into Cocks and Kings, becauſe all Men of Senſe believe that it is not ſo eaſie for any Body to become a Cock or a King. But Men in all Ages have thought they might be equal to the Gods. Their Vanity has infus'd this Opinion into 'em as a thing probable enough: They learn't it from their firſt Parents: For without doubt our firſt Parents were of that Opinion, when they obey'd the Devil, who tempted 'em with a Promiſe that they ſhould be like to God, <hi>Eritis ſicut Dii.</hi> The moſt pure Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences endu'd with Celeſtial Precepts and Clear Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, were ſo blinded by their own Pride, that they thought they might throw off the Yoak of Divine Authority, and ſeat themſelves upon the Throne of God. So that 'tis no wonder, if Men, who are inferior to Angels in Purity and Underſtanding, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don themſelves to the ſame Motions of their Vanity which blinds and ſeduces 'em.</p>
                     <p>If the Temptation of Grandeur and Independency be the ſtrongeſt of all, 'tis becauſe it ſeems to us, as it did to our Forefathers, more comformable to our Reaſon as well as to our Inclination; for we are not always ſenſible of our own Weakneſſes and Wants that cauſe us to ſtand in need of every thing. Had the Serpent menac'd our firſt Parents by telling 'em, That unleſs they eat of the Fruit which God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid 'em to eat, they ſhould be transform'd, the one into a Cock, the other into a Hen, I queſtion whether they would not have derided ſo fooliſh a Tempeation; for we ſhould have derided it our ſelves. But the Devil judging of others by himſelf, well knew that Ambition and deſire of Independency were the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The Second Reaſon why we look upon thoſe to be Madmen that believe themſelves to be transform'd into Cocks and Kings, and yet have not the ſame thoughts of thoſe who believe that no Body can hurt 'em, as being above all Pain, is this, becauſe they who are Hypochondraical diſplay their Miſtakes viſibly to all People, ſo that every body may be an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Error. But when <hi>Cato</hi> aſſures us, that they who ſtruck him never hurt him, he aſſerts it, or may aſſert it, with ſo much Confidence and Gravity, that a Man may juſtly queſtion whether he be really the ſame as he appears to be: And we may be inclin'd to think, that his Soul is not to be ſhaken, becauſe his Body ſeems to be immovable. For the outward Air of the Body is generally a mark of the inward diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Mind. So that a daring and undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lyar perſwades us ſometimes to believe things incredible; becauſe their talking with ſo much Confidence, is a Proof that affects the Senſes; and therefore a moſt effectual Argument that ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces the generality of People. Few there are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, who look upon the Stoicks as Viſionaries, or as Audacious Lyars, becauſe we have no ſenſible Proof of that which lies reſerv'd in their Breaſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Air of the Face is a moſt ſenſible Proof that eaſily impoſes upon us; beſides that our innate Vanity readily induces us to believe, that Man is capable of that Grandeur and Independency to which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is apparent, that thoſe Errors which abound in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Writings are of all others the moſt Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Contagious; becauſe they are a ſort of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, Inſinuating Errors, proportion'd to the Vanity of Mankind, and like to that wherein the Devil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd our firſt Parents. They are likewiſe array'd with thoſe Pompous and Magnificent Ornaments, which make way for 'em into moſt Mens Minds. They enter, take poſſeſſion, ſtupifie, and captivate 'em, not with a Blindneſs that inclines thoſe miſerable Mortals to Humility, a ſenſibleneſs of their own Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, and an acknowledgment of it before others,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:60613:148"/>but with a Haughty dazling Blindneſs, and a Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs accompanied with ſome falſe Glimmerings. And when once Men are ſmitten with this blindneſs of Pride, they preſently rank themſelves in the number of fine and great Wits. Others alſo reckon 'em in the ſame Order, and admire 'em. So that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be thought more Contagious than this Blindneſs, becauſe the Vanity and Senſuality of Men, the Corruption of their Senſes and Paſſions, diſpoſe them to be known thereby, and puts 'em alſo upon infecting others with it.</p>
                     <p>I believe then there is no Author more proper than <hi>Seneca,</hi> to demonſtrate how contagious the Imagination of ſome Men is, who are call'd fine and great Wits; and what a Command ſtrong and vigorous Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have over Weak and more Illiterate People; not by the ſtrength or evidence of their Arguments, which are the productions of Wit; but by a certain turn and livelineſs of Expreſſion, which depends upon the Force of Imagination.</p>
                     <p>I know well that this Author is highly eſteem'd in the World, and that I ſhall be accus'd of more than ordinary raſhneſs, for having ſpoken of him, as of a Man that had a Strong Imagination, but little Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it was chiefly by reaſon of this Eſteem, that I undertook to ſpeak of him; not out of Envy or any Moroſe Humour, but becauſe his great Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation will excite many to conſider more attentively thoſe Errors of his which I have hinted. We ought, as much as in us lies, to produce famous Examples for the confirmation of things that we aſſert, when they are of Conſequence, and he that Criticizes upon a Book ſometimes does it an honour. However it be, if I find fault with any thing in <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Writings, I am not ſingle in that Opinion; For not to ſpeak of ſome Illuſtrious Perſons in this Age, 'tis about 1600 years ago that a certain Judicious Author obſerv'd;</p>

3. That his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was more grounded upon the Imprudent Heat of Young Men, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by the conſent of the Wiſe and Learned.</p>
                     <p>'Tis in vain to Encounter palpable Errors with Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writings, becauſe they are not Contagious. 'Tis ridiculous to admoniſh Men that Hypochondraical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are in ſome meaſure mad; they know it well enough: But if they for whom they have a high value, miſtake, 'tis neceſſary to bid 'em have a care of ſuch, for fear leſt they adhere to their Errors. Now it is manifeſt that <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Spirit is a Spirit of Pride and Vanity. Therefore ſince Pride, according to the Scripture, is the Original of Sin, <hi>Initium peccati Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbia,</hi> the Spirit of <hi>Seneca</hi> cannot be the Spirit of the Goſpel. Nor can his Morals have any alliance with Chriſtian Morals, which are only true and ſolid.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain, that all <hi>Seneca</hi>'s thoughts are neither falſe nor dangerous: They who being endu'd with a found Wit, have attain'd the Doctrine of Chriſtian Morals, may read him to good advantage. Great Men have made a profitable uſe of him; neither is it my intention to blame thoſe, who being willing to comply with the weakneſs of other Men, who had ſo high an eſteem for him, have drawn Arguments from the Writings of that Author to defend the Morals of Jeſus Chriſt, and to engage the Enemies of the Goſpel with their own Weapons.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome good things in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and we find ſome true Prophecies in the Centuries of <hi>Noſtra Damus.</hi> We make uſe of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Religion of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and the Prophecies of <hi>Neſtra Damus</hi> may be ſerviceable to convince ſome Whimſical Perſons. But it does not follow, becauſe there is ſomething good in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> is to be call'd a good Book; as ſome true Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>Noſtra Damus</hi>'s Centuries will not make <hi>Noſtra Damus</hi> a Right Prophet; and they who make uſe of theſe Books to the ends aforeſaid, cannot be ſaid to have a real Eſteem for 'em.</p>
                     <pb n="251" facs="tcp:60613:149"/>
                     <p>It would be in vain for any Man to oppoſe what I have ſaid concerning <hi>Seneca,</hi> by bringing a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Paſſages out of that Author conformable to the ſolid Truths of the Goſpel. I agree that there are ſome ſuch, as there are alſo in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and in other Impious Books: And they would do me wrong, to overwhelm me with the Authority of an infinite number of People that have made uſe of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca;</hi> becauſe we may ſometimes make uſe of a Book which we believe to be impertinent, provided they with whom we have to deal, have not the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Author as we have.</p>
                     <p>To ruine all the Philoſophy of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> there needs but only one thing, ſufficiently prov'd by Experience, as alſo by what we have already ſaid: That we ſhould be bound to our Body, our Parents, our Friends, our Prince, our Country, by thoſe ties that we neither can, and which it would be a ſhame for us to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to break. Our Soul is united to our Body, and by means of our Body to all things viſible, by a Hand ſo powerful, that it is impoſſible for us to break that Union. 'Tis impoſſible to prick our Body, but the whole Individuum muſt be prick'd and hurt: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are in that condition, that this mutual Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony between us and the Body is abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. In like manner it is impoſſible for us to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd with Injuries and Contumelies, but we muſt be offended at 'em. For that God, who has made us to maintain Society with other Men, has endu'd us with a Propenſity to all that can join us together, which can never be vanquiſh'd by our ſelves. 'Tis meerly chimerical to ſay, that Pain does not hurt us, that Words of Scorn and Contempt do not offend us, becauſe we are above all this. No Mortal Man was ever above Nature, unleſs by an acceſſion of Grace; and never any Stoic deſpis'd Honour and the Eſteem of Men by the Strength and Conſtancy of his Mind only.</p>
                     <p>Men may overcome their Paſſions by contrary Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: They may vanquiſh Fear or Pain by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60613:150"/>perceiving the Eyes of many People upon 'em, deſire of Honour ſupports 'em, and ſtops thoſe Corporeal Motions that would induce 'em to fly. This is their Victory, if it may be call'd a Victory; but this is no delivering themſelves from Servitude; it may perhaps be ſaid, that they have only chang'd their Maſter for ſome time, or rather enlarg'd their Bondage: Such Men are only wiſe, happy, and free in outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, but in reality undergo a moſt ſevere and cruel Servitude. We may reſiſt our Natural Union with our Body by the help of our Union with Men. We may reſiſt Nature by the Strength of Nature: We may reſiſt God by the Strength that he has given us: But no Man can reſiſt God by the Strength of his own Wit; nor can Nature be overcome but by Grace, becauſe God cannot be overcome, if I may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſay ſo, without the ſpecial Aſſiſtance of God.</p>
                     <p>Thus that Magnificent Diviſion of all things, into thoſe things that have no dependence upon us, and upon which we ought not to depend, ſeems to be conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous to Reaſon, but not conformable to that diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly condition to which Sin has reduc'd us. We are united to all Creatures by the Appointment of God, but we abſolutely depend upon 'em through the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of Sin. So that ſince Felicity cannot ſubſiſt with Pain and Anxiety, we can never hope to be happy in this Life by imagining with our ſelves, that we do not depend upon thoſe Things to which we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally enſlav'd. All our Felicity in this Life is grounded upon a Lively Faith, and a Strong Hope, which afford us ſome ſort of Enjoyment of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Bliſs by way of Anticipation; and we may live according to the Precepts of Vertue, and vanquiſh Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, if ſupported by that Grace which Jeſus Chriſt has merited for us.</p>

                        <hi>MOntagne</hi>'s Eſſays may ſerve for another Proof of the Power which ſome Imaginations have over others. For that Author has a certain Free Air, and gives ſuch a natural and ſo lively a Turn to his Thoughts, that it is a difficult thing to read him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being entangled in his Snares. The Careleſneſs which he affects becomes him ſo well, that it renders him belov'd of all Men, but deſpis'd of none; and his Haughtineſs is the Haughtineſs of a worthy Good Man, that procures him all Veneration, but no Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. The Genteel and Free Air, ſupported by ſome Learning, works ſo prodigious effects upon Mens Minds, that they often admire him, and ſurrender to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions, without daring to examine him, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before they underſtand him. His Reaſons ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver convince, becauſe he never produces any, but what are weak and without any ſolidity: And indeed he has no Principles upon which to ground his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; nor does he obſerve any Order in drawing his Concluſions from Principles. For a Paſſage out of ſome Hiſtory proves nothing: a ſhort Fable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates nothing: two Verſes out of <hi>Horace;</hi> an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme out of <hi>Cleomenes</hi>'s or <hi>Caeſars,</hi> are not ſufficient to convince any Rational Man: Nevertheleſs his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays are no more than a Rapſody of Hiſtories, Fables, Sentences, Elegant Words, Diſticks, and Apothegms.</p>
                     <p>'Tis true that <hi>Montagne</hi> is not to be look'd upon in his Eſſays as a Man that argues, but only writes to divert himſelf, he indulges his Genius, and makes it his Buſineſs to pleaſe, but not to inſtruct; ſo that if all his Readers read him only to divertiſe themſelves, his Book would not be ſo dangerous. But 'tis almoſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60613:151"/>as impoſſible not to have that which delights us, as to refram from Meats that pleaſe our Taſte. The Mind can take no delight in reading an Author without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing his Sentiments, or at leaſt without receiving ſome Tincture, which, intermixing with his Idea's, render 'em confus'd and obſcure.</p>
                     <p>'Tis not only dangerous to read <hi>Montagne</hi> for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion ſake, becauſe the pleaſure Men take in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, engages them inſenſibly in his Opinions, but becauſe that Pleaſure is more capital than it is vulgarly thought to be: For certain it is, that Pleaſure ariſing principally from an eager Appetite, does but ferment and fortifie the Paſſions; and the Style of that Author therefore pleaſes us, becauſe it actects us and awakens our Paſſions after an imperceptible manner.</p>
                     <p>It would be much to the purpoſe to prove what we have ſaid in particular of <hi>Montagne</hi>'s Eſſays, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally that the delight we take in all the variety of Styles proceeds only from a ſecret Corruption of the Heart; but it is not here our deſign, it would carry us too far from our ſubject: Nevertheleſs, if we would but reflect upon the Connexion of the Idea's, and the Paſſions already mention'd, and upon what paſſes in our ſelves, at the ſame time we read a Piece that is well writ, we ſhall eaſily diſcover our ſelves to be moſt delighted with that Author that is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to our Affections and Diſpoſitions; if we are delighted with a ſublime noble and free Style, it is becauſe Vanity aſpires to Rule and Empire; if with a Soft and Effeminate Style, 'tis becauſe we are prone to Softneſs and Pleaſure. In a word, 'tis a certain Perception of Senſible Things, and not from any Perception of Truth, that we are even in ſpight of our Wills cheriſh'd and affected with certain Authors.</p>
                     <p>But to return to <hi>Montagne,</hi> I am of Opinion his chiefeſt Votaries give this reaſon for their admiring him, becauſe he is an Author judicious and free from Pedantry, and for that after a diligent Scrutiny he in a wonderful manner detected the Nature and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitmities of Mans Reaſon. If I then make it out that <hi>Montagne</hi> as much a Gentleman as he was, yet for
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60613:151"/>all that, was as much a Pedant as many others, and that he had a very mean knowledge of Human Reaſon, certainly I ſhall then make it evident that his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers were not compell'd into an Admiration of him by Convincing Reaſons, but by the Strength of that Authors Imagination.</p>
                     <p>The Word <hi>Pedant</hi> is very Equivocal, but in my Opinion Cuſtom and Reaſon require that we ſhould call thoſe Pedants, who to make a fair ſhew of their falſe Learning, quote at random all ſorts of Authors; who, to gain a Popular Applauſe, talk only for talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's ſake, and to make themſelves admir'd by Fools; who rake together without Judgment or Diſcretion Apothegms and Paſſages of Hiſtory, to prove, or make a ſhew of proving Things that cannot be prov'd but by Reaſons.</p>
                     <p>Pedants are oppos'd to Men that make uſe of their Reaſon, and that which renders 'em odious to Men of Worth and Senſe is this, that Pedants are Enemies to Reaſon. For Men of true Ingenuity love naturally ſound Arguments, nor can they endure the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Men that will not admit of the uſe of Reaſon. Now thoſe Perſons whom we have deſcrib'd can never argue truly, becauſe their Brains are very ſhallow, and ſtuff'd with falſe Learning beſides. Nor will they argue, becauſe they find that ſome Men admire 'em more when they cite any unknown Author, or any Sentence of an ancient Writer, than when they pretend to Reaſoning: So that their Vanity Congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating it ſelf for the Veneration that is paid 'em, cauſes 'em to apply themſelves to the Study of all thoſe Obſolete and unuſual Sciences, that procure the gaping aſtoniſhment of the Vulgar.</p>
                     <p>Pedants then are Vain and Arrogant, Men of great Memories, but of little Judgment, quick and abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Quotations, unfortunate and weak in their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; endu'd with a vigorous and ſpacious Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but volatile, irregular, and no ways able to contain it ſelf within the bounds of Exactneſs.</p>
                     <p>After all this, it will be no difficult thing to prove, that <hi>Montagne</hi> was as much a Pedant as ſeveral others,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60613:152"/>according to the Notion of the Word <hi>Pedant,</hi> which ſeems moſt conformable to Reaſon and Cuſtom. I ſpeak not here of Gown'd Pedants, or Schoolmaſters; 'tis not the Gown that makes a Pedant. <hi>Montagne,</hi> who had ſuch an averſion for Pedantry, might never wear a long Gown, but he could not ſo eaſily diſcharge himſelf of his peculiar Vices. He has labour'd to acquire a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Air, but he never ſtudied how to be Maſter of a Juſt Mind, or at leaſt his Studies prov'd ineffectual: And therefore he adorn'd his Wit with a ſort of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that did not taſte of the School, but was empty, vain, and trivial; while he neglected to cultivate his Reaſon, to corroborate his Judgment, and acquire to himſelf the Vertues of a Worthy Man.</p>

                        <hi>Montagne</hi>'s Book is ſtuff'd with ſo many Proofs of the Pride and Vanity of the Author, that it would be a needleſs thing perhaps to ſpend time in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enumeration of 'em. For he muſt be a Man extreamly conceited to believe, that People would read ſuch a large Book on purpoſe to underſtand the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and Humour of the Author. Certainly he muſt think himſelf ſeparated from the Vulgar, and look upon himſelf as ſome extraordinary Perſon. All Men are eſſentially oblig'd to turn the Mind of thoſe that are prone to reverence 'em, towards him who alone deſerves to be ador'd: And Religion teaches, that the Mind and Heart of Man, which were only made for God, ſhould never be taken up with our ſelves, nor ſtep at ſelf-admiration and ſelf-love. When St. <hi>John</hi> fell proſtrate at the Feet of the Angel of God, the Angel bid him riſe,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Montagne</hi> wrote his Eſſays, to no other end but to paint forth his own Humours and Inclinations; he himſelf confeſſes as much in his Advertiſement to the Reader inſerted in all the Editions, <hi>'Tis my ſelf that I paint forth, 'tis I that am the Subject of my own Book.</hi> And this is apparent enough to them that read it. For there are very few Chapters wherein he does not make ſome Digreſſion or other to ſpeak of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. And there are ſome whole Chapters which he conſumes in talking of no body elſe but himſelf. Wherefore, though he compos'd his Book to make the Portraiture of himſelf, yet he publiſh'd it for others to read. 'Twas therefore his deſign to turn the Gaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eyes and Attentions of all Men upon himſelf, though he ſays, <hi>he knew not any reaſon he had to imploy his Leiſure upon a Subject ſo vain and frivolous.</hi> Thus his own words condemn him. For if he thought there was no <hi>reaſon</hi> why Men ſhould employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in reading his Book, certainly he acted againſt Common Senſe in cauſing his <hi>Eſſays</hi> to be publiſh'd: Whence we are oblig'd to believe, that either he ſpoke one thing and thought another, or that he did amiſs to Print his Book.</p>
                     <p>'Tis alſo a very pleaſant Excuſe of his Vanity, to ſay, that he had never written but for the ſake of his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations:</hi> For if that were true, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did he ſuffer three Impreſſions? Would not one have been enough for his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relation?</hi> How came it to paſs that he enlarg'd his Book in the laſt Impreſſions, and never expung'd any thing out of it, unleſs it were becauſe Fortune favour'd his Intentions: I <hi>add,</hi> ſays he, <hi>but I never correct, for he that has once mortgag'd his Work to the Publick, in my Opinion, has no farther right to it. Let him ſay better if he can in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book. But let him not corrupt the work that he has ſold. At this rate nothing is to be purchas'd from ſuch Men till after they are dead. Let Men conſider well before they appear in publick: Who bids 'em make ſuch haſte? My Book is always one and the ſame.</hi> And therefore he mortgag'd and publiſh'd his Book as well to pleaſure other Men, as his <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Friends.</hi> But though
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:60613:153"/>he had endeavour'd to oblige his Friends and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions only, and to have turn'd their Minds and Hearts upon his Picture made by himſelf, all the time that was to be ſpent in reading his Book, certainly his Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was ne're the more to be excus'd.</p>
                     <p>If it be a fault for a Man to ſpeak often of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, certainly 'tis a piece of Impudence, or rather a kind of Madneſs for a Man to be always making Panegyries upon himſelf as <hi>Montagne</hi> does; for it is not only a Sin againſt Chriſtian Humility, but againſt Right Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Men were made to live together, and to form Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Bodies and Societies; but it is to be obſerv'd, that the Private Members which compoſe thoſe Societies, would not take it well to be accounted the meaneſt Member of the Body which they conſtitute. No wonder then if thoſe Men, that praiſe and extol them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above others, looking upon the reſt as the meaneſt Members of the Society, and conſidering themſelves the chiefeſt and moſt Honourable, incur the Hatred of all Men, inſtead of procuring their Love and Eſteem.</p>
                     <p>Therefore 'tis a Vanity, an Indiſcreet and Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Vanity for <hi>Montagne</hi> continually to ſpeak in Praiſe of himſelf; and it is a Vanity ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant in the ſame Author to deſcribe his own Faults: For, if you obſerve it, you ſhall find, that he only diſcovers thoſe Vices, which through the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Age Men pride themſelves in being guilty of; that he willingly aſcribes to himſelf thoſe that he thinks will procure him the Honour of a good Wit, and the Air of a Gentleman. And all this, that by a ſeeming ingenuous Confeſſion of his Vices, he may gain the more eaſie Belief when he flies out into his own Praiſes.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60613:153"/>bear with ſuch an unſanctified Pride, that glories in thoſe Vices which ſhould rather be an occaſion of Humility. I ſhould leſs impatiently brook a Man who is aſham'd to confeſs his faults, than another who is not afraid to make open proclamation of 'em. And, in my Opinion, there is no Man but ought to have a juſt dildain of that over free and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-like way wherein <hi>Montagne</hi> diſplays his Vices.

                     <p>Let us confeſs then, that <hi>Montagne excell'd in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſs;</hi> ſince he aſſures us, that he wiſhes we had the ſame Opinion of him, more eſpecially ſince it is no way repugnant to Truth. But we are unwilling to believe him upon his Word, or by the Applauſes which he beſtows upon himſelf, that he was a Man of Great Judgment, and extraordinary Sagacity of Mind. For being led by ſuch a prejudic'd Opinion, we might too eaſily aſſent to thoſe falſe and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Opinions which he obtrudes upon the World with an Impious Confidence and Boldneſs, which only ſtupifies and dazles weak Minds.</p>
                     <p>Another thing for which <hi>Montagne</hi> is in the ſecond place ſo highly commended, is, that he had a perfect knowledge of the Mind of Man, that he penetrated
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60613:154"/>into the moſt hidden Receſſes of it, the Nature and Properties, the Strength and Weakneſs of it; and in a Word, that knew all that could be known of it. Let us now ſee whether he merits theſe Elogies, and whence it comes to paſs that they are ſo liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon him.</p>
                     <p>They who have read <hi>Montagne,</hi> well know that he affected to be thought a <hi>Pyrrhonian,</hi> and that he took a pride in doubting of every thing.

On the other ſide, he beſtows ſuch large Encomiums up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Pryhonians</hi> in the ſame Chapter, that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to queſtion but that he was one of the ſame Sect. 'Twas neceſſary in his time for one that would be accounted an able and accompliſh'd Man, to doubt of every thing: And the Title of a great Wit, of which he was ambitious, engag'd him farther in thoſe his Opinions. Suppoſing him therefore to be an Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic alſo, we might, at once, convince him to be one of the moſt ignorant among Men; not only in what concerns the Nature of the Mind, but in every thing elſe. For ſince there is an Eſſential Difference between Knowing and Doubting, if the Academics ſpeak what they think, when they aſſure us they know nothing, we may juſtly ſay they are the moſt ignorant of all Men.</p>
                     <p>Nor are they only the moſt ignorant of all Men, but they are alſo the moſt obſtinate Aſſertors of the moſt Irrational Opinions: For they not only reject whatever is moſt certain, and moſt univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they may be accounted great Wits; but by the ſame violence of the Imagination, they pleaſe themſelves with talking after a deciſive manner of the moſt uncertain and improbable things. <hi>Montagne</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently labours under this Diſtemper; and therefore of neceſſity we muſt conclude, that he was not only ignorant of the Nature of Mans Mind, but alſo that he was intangled in many groſs Errors in reference to that Subject, granting that he ſpoke what he thought, as it became him to do.</p>

                     <p>But we muſt do Juſtice to all the World, and give a faithful Character of <hi>Montegne</hi>'s Parts. He had a bad Memory, and a worſe Judgment, 'tis true, but thoſe two Qualities together do not compoſe that which uſually the World calls the Beauty of the Mind. 'Tis the Elegancy, the Vivacity, the Extenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Imagination, that procures a Man the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60613:155"/>of being a good Wit. The Common ſort of People admire that which glitters, not that which is ſolid, becauſe they have a greater value for that which affects their Senſes, than for that which informs their Reaſon. And therefore miſtaking Elegancy of Imagination for Elegancy of Wit, it may be ſaid that <hi>Montagne</hi> had an Elegant and Extraordinary Wit. His Idea's are falſe, but ſplendid; his Expreſſions ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular or bold, but pleaſant; his Diſcourſes ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Reaſon, but well imagin'd. There is throughout his Book a Character of an Original which pleaſes infinitely: Though he be an Uſurper of others Mens Draughts, it may be ſaid that his Bold and Strong Imagination gives the Turn of an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to every thing he Copies. Laſtly, he has all thoſe things ready at hand, which are neceſſary to pleaſe and allure; nor have I obſcurely demonſtrated, as I am apt to believe, that he has acquir'd Admiration among ſo many Men, not by convincing their Reaſon by Evident Arguments, but by ſubduing their Minds by the Commanding and Victorious power of his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>

                     <p>There is nothing more terrible, or formidable to the Mind, or which produces in the Brain deeper Traces, than the Idea of an Inviſible Power, which we are not able to reſiſt, and which meditates nothing
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:60613:156"/>but to do us Miſchief: All Diſcourſes which revive that Idea are liſten'd to with Fear and Curioſity. Men adhering to every thing that is extraordinary, take a Phantaſtic delight to tell ſurprizing and prodigious Stories of the Power and Malice of Wizards, as well to frighten others, as to terrifie themſelves. So that 'tis no wonder that Wizards are ſo common in ſome Countreys, where the Belief of thoſe Nocturnal Meetings of Wizards called <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> has too much prevail'd; where all the moſt extravagant Tales of Witchcrafts are heard as ſo many Authentic Hiſtories, and where real Madmen and Viſionaries, whoſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination was at firſt diſordered as well by the rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of ſuch Tales, as by the Corruption of their own Hearts, are burnt for Wizards. I know that many People will blame me for attributing the greateſt part of Witchcrafts to the force of Imagination, becauſe there are ſome Men who delight in terrifying things, and are angry with thoſe that go about to diſabuſe 'em; and who are like thoſe that are ſick through the power of Imagination, who liſten moſt awfully to their Phyſicians, that foretell ſome diſmal thing that is to befall 'em, and obey their Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons exactly. Superſtition is not eaſily deſtroy'd, and when ever it is attacqued, it finds a great number of Champions; and this ſame proneneſs to believe all the Dotages of Daemonographers, is produc'd and cheriſh'd by the ſame cauſe that renders the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious obſtinate, as may be eaſily prov'd. However it will not be amiſs to ſet down in few Words, how, in my Judgment, ſuch Opinions as theſe came to get footing in the World.</p>
                     <p>A Shepherd in his Cottage, after Supper, tells his Wife and Children what was done at the Convention of <hi>Wizards</hi> called the <hi>Sabbat.</hi> Now when his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination comes to be heated by the Vapours of the Wine, and that he begins to believe himſelf to have been preſent at that Imaginary Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, he fails not to ſpeak of it after a ſtrong and vigorous manner. His Natural Eloquence, together with the Proneneſs of his Family to give Ear to ſo
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:60613:156"/>new and terrible a Story, could not but produce ſtrange Traces in their weak Imaginations: Nor is it otherwiſe naturally poſſible, that a Woman and little Children being frighten'd, ſhould be able to penetrate and reſiſt what they hear him ſay. 'Tis a Husband, 'tis a Father that talks of what he has ſeen, of what he has done; he is beloved and reſpected; why ſhould they not believe him? The Shepherd alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats his Story ſeveral days one after another. The Imagination of the Mother and the Children, admit by degrees much deeper traces of it: they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it; the fear vaniſhes, but the conviction remains; and by and by their Curioſity will not be at quiet till they go and anoint themſelves; they lay themſelves in their Beds in ſuch a poſture, and the ſame diſpoſition of their Mind, ſtill heats their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination more and more; the traces which the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd has form'd in their Brain, are ſo very much open'd, as to cauſe 'em in their Sleep to ſee as preſent all the Motions of the Ceremony, the deſcription of which they had heard. They riſe, ask one another, and tell each other what they have ſeen; by this means they confirm the traces of their Viſion; and they that have the ſtrongeſt Imagination more eaſily perſwading the reſt, they fail not in a few Nights to make a formal Story of this Imaginary Nocturnal Convention. Thus has the Shepherd made compleat Wizards; and they in a ſhort time will make a great many others, if being endu'd with a ſtrong and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Imagination, fear does not hinder them from relling ſuch like Stories.</p>
                     <p>There have been ſometimes Wizards in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, that is, ſuch as thought themſelves really ſo, and believed they went to Nocturnal Conventions; and who were ſo convinc'd of it, that though ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons wak'd them, and aſſur'd them that they never ſtirr'd out of their Beds, they would not believe their Teſtimony.</p>
                     <p>All the world knows, that ſtories of Hobgoblins being told to Children, affright 'em to that degree, that they will not be alone in the dark or without

Becauſe, when the Brain admits no Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of any preſent Object, that which was imprinted in their Brain by the help of the ſtory, opens it ſelf afreſh, and many times vehemently enough, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent before their Eyes the Apparitions they were told of; nevertheleſs theſe ſtories are not told 'em other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then as Fables. They that tell 'em, do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them with the ſame Air, as if they were convinc'd of the Truth of them, and many times the Relation it ſelf is cold and languiſhing. No wonder then, that a Man who believes he has been at a Nocturnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and by conſequence talks with a ſtedfaſt and confident utterance, eaſily perſwades ſome Perſons, that hear him with a kind of reſpect, of all the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which he particularizes, and tranſmits traces into their Imagination like to thoſe by which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was received.</p>
                     <p>When Men diſcourſe with us, they imprint traces in our Brains like to thoſe which they have themſelves. If they are deep, then they talk to us after ſuch a manner, as impreſſes 'em deep: for they cannot talk to us, but they muſt make us in ſome meaſure like themſelves. Infants in the Mothers Womb ſee nothing but what the Mother ſees; and when they come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, they imagine very few things, of which their Parents are not the cauſe; ſince the wiſeſt of Men, are govern'd rather by the Imagination of others, that is, by Opinion and Cuſtom, than by the Rules of Reaſon. Therefore in places where Wizards are burnt, there we find a great number of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the places where they are condemn'd to the Fire, 'tis really believed that they are Wizards, and that Opinion is more and more confirm'd by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſcourſes concerning them. Let 'em but ceaſe to puniſh them, and deal with 'em as Mad Folks, and you ſhall ſee that in a little time there will be no Wizards; becauſe they who are only ſo by the force of Imagination, and who are doubtleſs the Greateſt Number, would return from their Errors.</p>
                     <p>Moſt certainly real Wizards deſerve death: and they who are only ſo through the power of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:60613:157"/>ought not to be reputed altogether Innocent, for they uſually believe themſelves to be Witches becauſe they find in themſelves a diſpoſition to frequent No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cturnal Conventions, and for that reaſon anoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with certain Drugs, in order to accompliſh their wicked deſign, But while we puniſh without diſtinction all theſe Criminals, the Vulgar Opinion is confirm'd, Wizards multiply through the ſtrength of Imagination, and thus an Infinite number of People are loſt and condem'd to Eternal Damnation: Which is the reaſon that ſeveral Parliaments never puniſhing Wizards, there are fewer or hardly any to be found in places under their Juriſdiction, where the Envy, Hatred, and Malice of wicked People cannot make uſe of that pretence to deſtroy the Innocent.</p>
                     <p>The apprehenſion of <hi>Lycanthropi,</hi> or Men who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves chang'd into Wolves, is a Chimera no leſs Ridiculous. A Man, through an Irregular effort of his Imagination falls into ſuch a Phrenzie, that he believes himſelf transform'd into a Wolf every Night. This diſorder of his Mind diſpoſes him to all the Actions that are natural to Wolves, or whatever he has heard reported of them. Away he goes then, out of his Houſe at Midnight, runs about the Streets, falls upon the next Child he meets, bites him and handles him very rudely: Alſo ſtupid and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous People believe this Madman to be a real Wolf; becauſe the Poor unfortunate Fellow believes it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and for that he told it in private to ſome Perſons that told it again.</p>
                     <p>Were it caſie to form in the Brain thoſe Traces that perſwade Men they are chang'd into Wolves; or were it as eaſie to run about the Streets, and commit the Ravages which theſe Miſerable Wolf-Men commit without being abſolutely Mad, as it is to go in a Dream to a Nocturnal Convention, theſe ſtories of Men transform'd into Wolves, would not fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects as the Tales of Nocturnal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and we ſhould have as many Wolf-men as Wizards. But the belief of being transform'd into a Wolf ſuppoſes a great diſorder of the Brain, which is
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:60613:158"/>more difficult to be produc'd, then the Delirium of a Man that only believes his going in the Night to a Nocturnal Convention; that is, who believes he ſees in the Night-time things that are not, and who when he wakes, cannot diſtinguiſh his Dreams from his Thoughts in the day time.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a uſual thing for ſome People to Dream ſuch lively Dreams in the Night time, as to remember 'em exactly when they wake, though the Dream in it ſelf be not very terrible: therefore 'tis no difficult thing for ſome Men to perſwade themſelves that they were at a Nocturnal Convention; for 'tis ſufficient to that end, that the Brain preſerve the Traces that were made in it by the Dream it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>The chief thing that hinders us from taking Dreams for Realties is, becauſe we cannot unite our Dreams to thoſe things which we did when we were awake; for thereby we find they were only Dreams. Now Imaginary Wizards cannot judge from thence whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Nocturnal Convention were nothing but a meer Dream. For they never go to their Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but in the Night, and what paſſes in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly cannot be united to their other Actions in the day time: So that 'tis Morally impoſſible that way to undeceive 'em. Nor is it neceſſary, that what Imaginary Wizards think they ſee in their Nocturnal Aſſemblies ſhould be united together in any Natural Order: for the more confuſed and Extravagant they are, ſo much the more real they appear to be. 'Tis therefore ſufficient that the Idea's of things done in the Aſſembly ſhould be Lively and Terrible; which will of neceſſity happen, becauſe that always unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual news, and extraordinary things, are there believed to be performed.</p>
                     <p>But it requires ſo great a diſturbance of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination for a Man to believe himſelf to be tranform'd into a Cock, a Goat, a Wolf, or an Ox, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not happen but very rarely; though theſe great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Brain do ſometimes fall out, either as a Puniſhment inflicted from Heaven, as the Scripture relates of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> or through a Natural
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60613:158"/>tranſport of Melancholly in the Brain; of which we find ſeveral Examples among Phyſical Writers.</p>
                     <p>Although I am perſwaded that real Wizards are very rare, that theſe Nocturnal Conventions are meer Dreams, and that the Parliaments who diſmiſs thoſe accuſations of Witchcraft, are the moſt juſt and Equitable: Nevertheleſs, I doubt not but that there are any Wizards Charms, Inchantments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that the Devil does ſometimes thus exerciſe his Malice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Men by a particular permiſſion of God, For the Scripture teaches us that the Kingdom of Satan is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; that the Angel of God has thrown the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil bound in Chains into the deep Abyſs, from whence he ſhall not be releaſed till the end of the World: that Jeſus Chriſt has deſpoil'd him of his Weapons, and that the time ſhall come, when the Prince of the World ſhall be Expell'd out of the World.</p>
                     <p>He had Reign'd indeed till the coming of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and he ſtill Reigns in ſuch places where our Saviour is not known: but he has no longer any Right or any Power over thoſe that are regenerated in Chriſt. He cannot tempt them but by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God; or if God gives him leave, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are able to vanquiſh him: Therefore they too much honour the Devil, who relate Stories as Arguments of his Power, as ſome of our Modern <hi>Demonographers</hi> do; ſince ſuch kind of ſtories render him formidable to weak People.</p>
                     <p>Devils are to be deſpiſed, as we deſpiſe Hangmen. For we ought to tremble only before God. His Power only is to be fear'd. We ought to be afraid of his Judgments and Wrath, and not provoke him by the Contempt of his Laws and Goſpel. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our Attention when he ſpeaks, or when Men ſpeaks to us concerning him. But when Men ſpeak to us concerning the Power of the Devil, 'tis a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous thing to be troubled and diſmay'd: Our Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is an Honour to him: He loves to be reſpected and fear'd, and his Pride is ſatisfy'd, when we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves before him.</p>
                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:60613:159"/>
                     <p>'Tis now time to conclude this Second Book, and only to obſerve from what has been ſaid in this and the preceding. 1. That all our thoughts which the Mind has by means of the Body, or by depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Body, are only for the uſe of the Body it ſelf. 2. That they are all falſe and Obſcure. 3. That they ſerve to no other uſe then to unite us to ſenſible Good, and to all things that can procure 'em for us; and that this Union leads us into infinite Errors, and very great Miſeries. Though we are not always ſenſible or them, no more then we know the Errors from whence they ariſe, Of this we ſhall give the following remarkable Example.</p>
                     <p>Our Union with our Mothers in the Womb, which is far more ſtrict then any we can have with Men, is the cauſe of our greateſt Miſchiefs; that is to ſay, of Sin and Concupiſcence, which are the Original of all our Miſeries. Nevertheleſs, there was a Neceſſity that this Union ſhould be ſo ſtrict as it is to compoſe the ſtructure of Bodies.</p>
                     <p>This Union which was broken by our Birth is ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by another, whereby Children are joyn'd to their Parents and Nurſes. This Union is leſs ſtrict than the firſt, and therefore does leſs miſchief. It only enclined us to believe and imitate our Parents and Nurſes in all things. 'Tis viſible alſo, that this Second Union was neceſſary for us, not as the firſt for the Forming but the Preſervation of the Body; to the end we might underſtand all things that conduce to the Benefit of it, and to diſpoſe the Body to thoſe Motions which are neceſſary for the procuring thoſe Things.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, The Union which we have at preſent with all Men does us a great deal of Miſchief, though it be not ſo ſtrict, as being leſs neceſſary for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Body. For by reaſon of this Union it is, that we live by Opinion, that we love and eſteem what other Men love and value, though contrary to our Conſciences, and the true Idea's which we have of things. I ſpeak not here of that Union which conjoyns us with the Minds of other Men; for that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60613:159"/>Union may prove ſerviceable for our Inſtruction: I ſpeak of the Senſible Union between the Imagination, and the Air and Manner of thoſe with whom we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. Thus it is plain, that all our thoughts that we, have by way of dependency upon the Body, are falſe, and ſo much the more pernitious to the Mind, as they are more uſeful to the Body.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore endeavour by degrees to free our ſelves from the Deluſions of our Senſes from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of our Imagination, and the Impreſſion which the Imagination of other Men makes upon our Minds. Let us carefully reject all theſe confuſed Idea's, which we have drawn from that Servitude wherein our Body detains us; and let us only admit the clear and manifeſt Ideas which the Mind receives from that Union which it neceſſarily has with the <hi>WORD,</hi> or <hi>WISDOM</hi> and <hi>ETERNAL TR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TH;</hi> as we ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in the following Book, which treats of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, or Pure Mind.</p>

                     <p>THE Subject of this Third Treatiſe is a little Dry and Barren: We here examine the Mind conſidered in it ſelf, and Independent of the Body, to know the Weakneſſes which are peculiar to it, and the Errors which it has only from it ſelf. The Senſes and Imagination are Fruitful and Inexhauſtible Sources of our Errors and Illuſions, but the Mind
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60613:161"/>acting of it ſelf is not ſo ſubject to Error. We were troubled to finiſh the two preceding Treatiſes, and we are uneaſie to begin this; it is not becauſe the Nature or Properties of the Mind is a barren Subject, but becauſe we enquire not ſo much here into its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties as Weakneſſes. Let no one be Surpriſed if this Treatiſe is not ſo large, nor diſcovers ſo many Errors as the preceding Books; nor let any one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain if the Subject is a little dry, ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> it Senſible, will obſcure it, it's enough to make it Intelligible: There is nothing ſo Unjuſt, as the common Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of thoſe, who would know every thing, but would apply their Mind to nothing; they are angry if we deſire them to become Attentive; they would always have us Affect and Flatter their Senſes and Paſſions. But why? We know we cannot ſatisfie them. Thoſe who make Romances and Comedies, are oblig'd to pleaſe and captivate the Attention; 'tis enough for us to inſtruct thoſe who endeavour to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Attentive.</p>
                     <p>The Errors of the Senſes and Imagination depend upon the Nature and Conſtitution of the Body, and are diſcover'd by conſidering the Power they have over the Soul; but the Errors of the Pure Underſtanding cannot be diſcover'd, but by conſidering the Nature of the Mind it ſelf, and of the Idea's which are neceſſary to it, in order to know Objects. So that to penetrate into the Cauſes of the Errors of the Pure Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it will be neceſſary for us to inſiſt in this Book, upon the Conſideration of the Nature of the Mind, and of Intellectual Idea's.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall firſt ſpeak of the Mind as it is in it ſelf, and without any relation to the Body to which it is united: So that what we ſhall ſay of it, might be ſaid of Pure Intelligences, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd with greater Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we here call it the Pure Underſtanding: By the word <hi>Pure <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> we pretend not to deſign that Faculty which the Mind has of knowing Objects
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60613:161"/>without us, without framing Corporeal Images of them in the Brain to repreſent them: We ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards treat of Intellectual Idea's, by whoſe means the Pure Underſtanding perceives Objects with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us.</p>
                     <p>I do not believe, that after having thought Seriouſly,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Thought only is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential to the Mind. To Think and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine are only its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications.</hi>
                        </note> we can doubt, that the Eſſence of the Mind conſiſts only in Thought, even as the Eſſence of Matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in Extenſion: And that according to the different Modifications of Thinking, the Mind can now Will, then Imagine, and laſtly Participate of many other particular Forms; ſo that according to the different Modifications of Extenſion, Matter is now Water, then Fire, and is capable of infinite other particular Forms.</p>
                     <p>By the word <hi>Thought,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">By the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a thing, I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that which is firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a thing, upon which all the Modifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in that thing, depend.</note> I do not here underſtand particular Modifications of the Soul, that is, Such or ſuch a Thought, but a Thought that is capable of all kinds of Modifications or Thoughts, even as by Extenſion, I do not underſtand ſuch or ſuch a ſort of Extenſion, as Round, Square, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but an Extenſion capable of all ſorts of Modifications or Figures: And there was no need of this Compariſon, but becauſe we have not ſo clear an Idea of Thought as of Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for Thought is only known by an interior Sentiment or by <hi>Conſcience,</hi> as ſhall hereafter be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
                     <p>I do not believe it poſſible,
<note n="*" place="margin">Second Part of the <hi>Pure Mind,</hi> Chap. 7.</note> to conceive a Mind which cannot Think, although it's eaſie to conceive one which neither Thinks, Imagines nor Wills; even as it's impoſſible to conceive Matter that is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; though one may eaſily conceive it to be neither Earth, Metal, Square, Round, and even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Motion. Hence we may conclude, That as there may be Matter, which is neither Earth, Metal, Square, Round, or without Motion; ſo there may alſo be a Mind, which is neither Senſible of Heat or Cold, which neither Rejoyces, is Sad, Imagines or Wills any thing: So that all theſe Modifications are not Eſſential to it; Thought only is of the Eſſence of the Mind, as Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion only is of the Eſſence of Matter.</p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60613:162"/>
                     <p>But even as if Matter or Extenſion were without Motion, it would be wholly uſeleſs, and incapable of this Variety of Forms for which it was deſign'd: And as it would be impoſſible to conceive an Intelligent Being to Will ſuch a Creation, (that is, Matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Motion, or incapable of Form,) ſo, if the Mind or Thought were without Will, it's evident that it would be wholly uſeleſs, ſince it would be ſometimes carried towards the Objects of its Perceptions, and would not love the Good for which it was made; ſo that it is impoſſible to conceive that an Intelligent Being would create it in this Eſtate. Nevertheleſs, as Motion is not Eſſential to Matter, as Extenſion is, ſo to <hi>Will</hi> is not Eſſential to the Mind, ſince <hi>Willing</hi> ſuppoſes Perception.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Thought only is properly Conſtitutive of the Eſſence of the Mind, and the different Manners of Thinking, as Perceiving and Imagining, are only the Modifications of which it is capable, and with which it is not always modified: But to <hi>Will,</hi> is a Property which always accompanies it, whether it be united to, or ſeparated from the Body; which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is not Eſſential to it, ſince it ſuppoſes Thought, and we may conceive a Mind without Will, even as a Body without Motion.</p>
                     <p>The Power of Willing is always Inſeparable from the Mind, although it is not Eſſential to it; for even as it is impoſſible to conceive Matter that cannot be moved, ſo it is impoſſible to conceive a Mind which cannot <hi>Will,</hi> or which is incapable of any Natural Inclination; but as we conceive Matter can exiſt without Motion, ſo we can conceive a Mind to exiſt without any Impreſſion from the Author of Nature towards Good, and conſequently without Will, for the Will is nothing elſe but an Impreſſion of the Author of Nature,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>We do not know all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difications of which our Soul is capable.</hi>
                        </note> which carries us towards Good in general, as we have more largely explain'd in the firſt Chapter of the Treatiſe upon the Senſes.</p>
                     <p>What we ſaid before in the Treatiſe upon the Senſes, and what we have juſt now ſaid of the Nature of the Mind, does not ſuppoſe that we know all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60613:162"/>Modifications whereof it is capable; we do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch things, but rather believe that there is in the Mind of Man a Capacity of receiving Succeſſively an infinite Number of different Modifications which the Mind it ſelf is Ignorant of.</p>
                     <p>The leaſt Portion of Matter can receive a Figure of three, ſix, ten, or Ten Thouſand ſides, or a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular or Ecliptick Figure, which may be conſider'd as made up of an Infinity of Angles and Sides. There is an infinite number of different Species of each of theſe Figures; an infinite number of Triangles of different kinds; beſides other Figures of four, ſix, ten, or Ten Thouſand ſides, and infinite Poligons. For the Circle, the Ellipſis, and generally every regular or irregular curve-lin'd Figure, may be conſider'd as an infinite Poligone. The Ellipſis, for example, as an infinite Poligone, but whoſe Angles or ſides are unequal, being greater towards the leſſer Diameter than the other. And thus of infinite other Poligones more compounded and irregular.</p>
                     <p>A ſimple piece of Wax is capable of infinite, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinitely infinite different Modifications which no Mind can comprehend. What reaſon then is there to imagine, that the Soul which is more noble than the Body, is not capable of more Modifications beſides thoſe which it has yet receiv'd.</p>
                     <p>If we had never felt Pain nor Pleaſure, if we had never ſeen Colour or Light, or if we had been as Blind or Deaf in relation to Colours and Sounds, ought we thence to conclude, that we were incapable of all the Senſations which we now have of Objects, ſince theſe Senſations are only Modifications of our Soul, as we have proved in the Treatiſe of the Senſes?</p>
                     <p>We muſt then grant, that the Capacity which the Soul has of receiving different Modifications, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably greater than the Capacity which it has of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; I mean, as the Mind cannot draw out, or conceive all the Figures whereof Matter is capable; ſo it cannot comprehend all the different Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the powerful Hand of God can produce in the Soul, even though we ſhould as diſtinctly know
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60613:163"/>the Capacity of the Soul, as that of Matter: Which is Abſurd from the Reaſons brought in the Seventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Second Part of this Book.</p>
                     <p>Our Soul therefore receives very few Modifications here, becauſe it is united to the Body upon which it depends: All its Senſations carry it to its Body; and whereas it cannot enjoy God, it can have no other Modifications beſides what the other Enjoyments pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Matter, which our Body is compoſed of, is capable of very few Modifications in this Life; this Matter cannot be reſolv'd into Earth and Vapour till after Death; it cannot now become Air, Fire, Diamond, Metal; it cannot be Square, Round, Triangular, it muſt be Fleſh, and have the Figure of Man, that the Soul may be united to it. It is even ſo with our Soul, it is neceſſary that it have Senſations of Heat, Cold, Colour, Light, Sounds, Odours, Sapors, and many other Modifications, that it may be united to its Body. All theſe Senſations engage it to the Preſervation of its Machine, they agitate it and terrifie it ſo ſoon as the leaſt Spring is looſed or broken: And thus the Soul muſt be ſubject thereto, as long as the Body ſhall be ſubject to Corruption; but as ſoon as it ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Immortality, and there ſhall be no farther Fear of a Diſſolution of its Parts, it's reaſonable to believe, that it will no longer be affected with theſe Incommodious Senſations which we unwillingly feel, but with an Infinity of all other different Things, of which we have now no Idea; which ſhall ſurpaſs all our Thoughts, and be worthy of the Greatneſs and Goodneſs of God, whom we ſhall enjoy.</p>
                     <p>'Tis therefore againſt all Reaſon, that Men imagine to penetrate ſo into the Nature of the Soul, as to be well aſſur'd, that it's only capable of Knowing and Loving. This indeed might be maintain'd by thoſe who attribute their Senſations to External Objects, or to their own Body, or who pretend that their Paſſions are in their Heart: For indeed, if we retrench from the Soul, all its Paſſions and Senſations, whatever can be known in that which is left behind, is only a Chain of Knowledge and Love. But I cannot apprehend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60613:163"/>how thoſe who have taken their leave of the Illuſions of their Senſes, can be perſwaded that all our Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Paſſions are only Knowledge and Love; I mean, the confuſed kinds of Judgments which the Soul draws from Objects relating to the Body which it Animates.</p>
                     <p>I do not apprehend how it may be ſaid, That Light, Colours, Odours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are Judgments of the Soul, for on the contrary it ſeems to me, that Colours, Odours, and other Senſations, are Modifications very different from Judgments.</p>
                     <p>Let us chooſe ſome of the quickeſt Senſations which moſt affect the Mind, and let us ſee what theſe Men can ſay of Colour or of Pleaſure: They think ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to many very Famous
<note n="*" place="margin">St. Aug. Book 6. <hi>De Muſica</hi> Deſcartes, <hi>dans ſon homme,</hi> &amp;c.</note> Authors, that theſe Senſations are only Conſequences of the Faculty, which we have of Knowing and Willing; and that Pain, for Example, is nothing elſe but a certain Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citude, Repugnancy and Averſion of the Will, againſt things which it knows to be Hurtful to its Dear Body: But it's evident to me, that this is to confound Pain with Sadneſs, and make Pain a Conſequence of the Knowledge and Action of the Will, whereas on the contrary it precedes both.</p>
                     <p>For Example, If a hot Coal was put into the Hand of a Perſon that was aſleep, or ſhould hold his Hands behind his Back, no one, I believe, with any proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Truth, would affirm, that this Perſon would forthwith know, that there were ſome Motions in his Hands contrary to a good Conſtitution of Body, that afterwards his Will would oppoſe it, and that this Pain would be a Conſequence of this Knowledge of his Mind, and this Oppoſition of his Will: But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the contrary, the firſt thing that this Perſon would conceive, when the Coal touch'd his Hand, would be Pain; and this Knowledge of the Mind, and Oppoſition of the Will, would be only Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of Pain, though indeed they were the Cauſe of Sadneſs which followed the Pains.</p>
                     <p>But there is much difference between the Pain and the Sadneſs which it produces, Pain is the firſt thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60613:164"/>which the Soul feels, it precedes Knowledge, and can never be agreeable in it ſelf: But on the contrary, Sadneſs is the laſt thing which the Soul feels, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge always precedes it, and it is always pleaſant in it ſelf: This is evident from the Pleaſure we perceive at the Lamentable Repreſentations of Tragedies, for this Pleaſure increaſes with the Sadneſs, but Pleaſure never increaſes with Pain. Comedians, who ſtudy the Art of Pleaſing, know well that the Stage is not to be imbru'd with Slaughter, becauſe the Image of a Murder is rather Terrible than Pleaſant: But they are not afraid to affect the Spectators with too great a Sadneſs, becauſe indeed Sadneſs is always agreeable, when there is a proper Subject of Sadneſs; there is then an Eſſential Difference betwixt Sadneſs and Pain, and one cannot ſay that Pain is only a Knowledge of the Mind joyn'd to an Oppoſition of the Will.</p>
                     <p>As for other Senſations, ſuch as Odours, Sapours, Sounds, Colours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the greateſt part of Men do not think them to be Modifications of the Soul, but on the contrary, that they are diſperſed upon Objects; or at leaſt, they are in the Soul as the Idea of a Square or Circle, that is, They are united to the Soul, but are not Modifications thereof: They judge thus of them, becauſe they are not more affected by them, as was ſhown in the Explanation of the Errors of the Senſes.</p>
                     <p>We muſt therefore agree, that we know not all the Modifications whereof our Soul is capable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe which it has by the Organs of the Senſes, it may have innumerable more which it has not yet try'd, nor ſhall know, till it be deliver'd from the Priſon of its Body.</p>
                     <p>However we muſt confeſs, that even as Matter is capable of infinite Configurations, becauſe of its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, ſo it's viſible that the Soul would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of the Modifications of Pleaſure, Pain, nor even of all others which are indifferent to it, if it were incapable of Perception or Thought.</p>
                     <p>It is ſufficient therefore to know, that the Principle of all theſe Modifications is Thought; and if any one
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60613:164"/>will have it, that there is any thing in the Soul ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to Thought, I ſhall not diſpute it; but as I am certain that no one has any knowledge of his Soul but by Thought, or by an internal Sentiment of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever paſſes in his Mind, ſo I am alſo aſſur'd, that if any one will reaſon upon the Nature of the Soul, he muſt conſult this internal Sentiment, which will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways repreſent him to himſelf ſuch as he is; and he muſt not imagin againſt his own Conſcience, that the Soul is an inviſible Fire, a ſubtil Air, a Harmony, or other like thing.</p>

<note place="margin">I. <hi>The mind being limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any thing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</hi>
                        </note> that the Human Mind is very much limited; from whence two very important Conſequences may be drawn. The firſt, That the Soul can have no perfect Knowledge of Infinity. The ſecond, That it can't know diſtinctly many things at the ſame time. For as a piece of Wax is not capable of having many different Figures at the ſame time; ſo neither is the Soul capable of having the knowledge of many things at the ſame time. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a piece of Wax cannot be Square, and Round at the ſame time, but only part Square and part Round; and ſo many more different Figures it ſhall have, they will be ſo much the leſs perfect, and diſtinct: Thus the Soul cannot perceive many things at once, and its Thoughts are ſo much the more confuſed as they are greater in Number.</p>
                     <p>If a piece of Wax ſhould have a Thouſand Sides, and in each Side a different Figure, it would be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60613:165"/>Square, Round, nor Oval, and we could not ſay of what Figure it would be; ſo it happens ſometimes, that we have ſo great a number of different Thoughts, that we imagin we think nothing at all, as happens to thoſe that are in a Swound. The Animal Spirits turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing irregularly in the Brain, ſtirs up ſo great a number of Traces, that they do not ſufficiently open any one of 'em, to excite a particular or diſtinct Idea in the Mind; ſo that theſe perſons perceive ſo great a number things at once, that they perceive nothing diſtinct, which induces them to think, they have perceived nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome who ſometimes Swound away for want of Animal Spirits; but then the Soul having only thoughts of pure Intellection, which leave no Traces in the Brain, they remember nothing when they come to themſelves again; which makes them believe they thought of nothing. I have ſaid this by the by, to ſhew thoſe are miſtaken, who believe the Soul does not think always, becauſe it ſometimes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins that it thinks on nothing.</p>
                     <p>Every one that does but reflect a little upon their own Thoughts,

                        </note> have experience enough, that the Mind cannot apply it ſelf to many things at the ſame time, and much more, that it cannot penetrate into Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Yet I know not by what Caprice ſome perſons, who are not ignorant of this, buſie themſelves more about the ſtudy of infinite Objects, and ſuch Queſtions as require an infinite Capacity of the Mind, than about what better ſuits the Capacity of their own Minds; and alſo why there are a great number of others that are deſirous to know every thing, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſo many Sciences in the ſame time, that it confounds them, and makes them uncapable of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Science truly.</p>
                     <p>How many Men are there who would comprehend the infinite Diviſibility of Matter, and how a little Grain of Sand contains as many parts as the whole World, although much leſs in proportion. How many Queſtions are formed upon theſe Subjects which are never reſolved; and upon many others which include
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60613:165"/>any thing of Infinity, which yet they would find a Solution of in their own Minds. They apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it with all poſſible Attention: But at laſt all they gain is this, they are prejudic'd with ſome Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance, and Error.</p>
                     <p>Is it not a pleaſant thing to ſee ſome Men, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the infinite Diviſibility of Matter, from hence only, becauſe they cannot comprehend it? Although they very well comprehend the demonſtrations that prove it, and at the ſame time confeſs, that the Human Mind cannot comprehend Infinity. The Proofs which are brought for the infinite Diviſibility of Matter, are as Demonſtrative as any thing elſe in Nature, and theſe Men confeſs it when they ſeriouſly conſider them; however, if we propoſe to them ſuch Objections as they cannot Solve, their Mind leaves that Evidence, which juſt before they perceived, and they begin to doubt of it; they are ſtrongly poſſeſt with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection they cannot Reſolve, and invent ſome frivolous diſtinction againſt the demonſtrations of the Infinite Diviſibility of Matter; and at laſt they conclude they were deceiv'd, as alſo the World with them; and ſo embrace the contrary Opinion. This they defend with Chimerical Atoms, and other like Abſurdities with which the Imagination always furniſhes them: Now the Original of all their Errors is this, they are not inwardly convinc'd, that the Mind of Man is Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and that to be perſwaded of the infinite Diviſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Matter, it is not neceſſary to Comprehend it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all Objections that cannot be reſolv'd without Comprehending it, are Objections which its impoſſible to Reſolve.</p>
                     <p>If Mens Curioſity would be terminated by Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Nature, we ſhould have no great reaſon to be concern'd; for if ſome Men were prepoſſeſſed with ſuch Errors, they are Errors of little Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: As for others, they have not wholly loſt their time, in thinking of things which they cannot comprehend; for they are at leaſt convinc'd of the weakneſs of their Mind. It is good, ſays a very Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Author, thus to fatigue the Mind with theſe

                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60613:166"/>kind of Subtilties, to tame its Preſumption, and abate its Arrogance in oppoſing its little Light to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Religion, which it cannot comprehend. For ſince all the Vigour of Mans Mind is conſtrained to ſubmit to the leaſt Atom of Matter, and to confeſs, that it ſees clearly that it is infinitely Diviſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to comprehend how it may be done, Is not this to Sin againſt evident Reaſon, to refuſe an Aſſent to the marvellous Effects of Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence (which is incomprehenſible in it ſelf) for this reaſon, becauſe our Mind cannot comprehend them?</p>

                        </note> or rather inadvertency, wherein the weakneſs and limitation of Mans Mind is Notorious, and conſequently, of his incapacity to comprehend whatever relates to infinity, is Hereſie. Theſe preſent times gives more inſtances than the former, of a great number of Men who are the Authors of a particular Theology, which is only founded upon their own Mind, and the Natural Weakneſs of Reaſon, they will not believe what they cannot comprehend.</p>
                     <p>The Socinians cannot comprehend the Myſteries of the Trinity, nor of the Incarnation. This is ſufficient for them not to believe them, and to Cenſure others with a fierce and libertine Air that do believe them, as Men born for Slavery.</p>
                     <p>A Man who is convinced in himſelf that he is free, if he troubles his Head very much in endeavouring to reconcile the Knowledge of God and his Decrees with that Liberty: Such a Man I ſay, is very likely to fall into their Error, who believe that Men are not free. For on the one hand, being unable to conceive how the Providence of God can conſiſt with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Man; and on the other, a reſpect for Religion will hinder him from denying a Providence, he will believe himſelf conſtrain'd to Abridge their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not ſufficiently reflecting upon the Weakneſs of his own Mind, he will imagine that he can pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the means that God has to reconcile his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees with our Liberty.</p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:60613:166"/>
                     <p>But they are not only Hereticks which are not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive enough to conſider the Weakneſs of their Mind, and which take too great a liberty of judging things out of their Juriſdiction; almoſt all Men have this defect, particularly ſome Divines of theſe laſt Ages; for ſome of them do ſo often make uſe of their Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Reaſonings, to prove or explain Myſteries which ſurpaſs Reaſon, although they may do it out of a good deſign, and to defend Religion againſt Hereticks, that they often give occaſion to the ſame Hereticks to perſiſt obſtinately in their Errors, and to treat of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheries of Faith as Human Opinions.</p>
                     <p>The Motions of the Mind, and the Subtilties of the Schools, are improper to inform Men of their Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to inſpire them with a Spirit of Humility, which is ſo neceſſary in the Myſteries of Religion. But all theſe Human and Subtle Reaſonings may, on the contrary, ſtir up their ſecret Pride, and incline them to make an ill uſe of their Judgment, and ſo to form a Religion agreeable to their own Capacity. We do not ſee Hereticks ſubmit themſelves to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick Arguments, or that the reading of Scholaſtick Books purely does inform them, or condemn their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: But on the contrary, they continually take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the weakneſs of ſome Scholaſtick Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to Ridicule the moſt ſacred Myſteries of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which indeed are not eſtabliſh'd upon all theſe Human Reaſonings and Explanations, but only upon the Authority of the written Word of God.</p>
                     <p>Indeed Human Reaſon does not teach us that there is one God in three Perſons; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>or how can it be, that the mind of Man is free, although God knew from Eternity all that Man would do: The Reaſons that are brought to prove and explain theſe things, are ſuch only as prove them to thoſe, which will admit them without examining them; but which often ſeem extravagant to thoſe who will oppoſe them, denying the foundation of theſe Myſteries. It may be ſaid on the contrary, that the Objections which are form'd againſt the principal Articles of our Faith, and eſpecially againſt the Myſtery of the Trinity
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60613:167"/>are ſo ſtrong, that its impoſſible to give clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Solutions of them, and which do not in the leaſt ſhock our weak Reaſon; becauſe indeed theſe Myſteries are incomprehenſible.</p>
                     <p>'Tis a better way to Convert Hereticks, not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom them to make uſe of their Reaſon, by propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to them ſuch uncertain Arguments as are drawn from Philoſophy; becauſe the Truths in which we ſhould inſtruct them do not depend upon Reaſon; nor is it always neceſſary to make uſe of theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in Truth that may be prov'd by Reaſon, as well as by Tradition; as the Immortality of the Soul, Original Sin, the neceſſity of Grace, the diſorder of Nature, and ſome others; for fear leſt their Mind having once taſted the Evidence of Reaſon in theſe Queſtions, ſhould not afterwards be content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to thoſe that cannot otherwiſe be proved but by Tradition: We muſt on the contrary, oblige them to diſtruſt their own Mind, by ſhewing them its weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, limitation, and diſproportion to myſterious Truths; and when the Pride of their Spirit ſhall be abated, they will be more eaſily brought over to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Religion, by ſhewing to them its Authority, and explaining the Tradition of all Ages if they are capable of it.</p>
                     <p>But if Men continually divert themſelves from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weakneſs and limitation of their Mind, an indiſcreet preſumption will lift them up, a deceitful Light will dazle them, and the Love of Glory will blind them: Thus Hereticks will be Eternally Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks; Philoſophers, opinionative and prejudic'd; and there will never be any end of Diſputation ſo long as we ſhall be willing to Diſpute with them.</p>

For we ought to Study methodically, and make uſe of what we know diſtinctly, to apprehend what we know not, or what we know but confuſedly: However, the greateſt part of thoſe who Study do not take this Courſe; they make no Eſſay upon their own Strength; they conſult not themſelves, to know what they are capable of. 'Tis a ſecret Vanity, and an irregular deſire of knowing; and not Reaſon which rules their Studies: They begin inconſiderately to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60613:168"/>into the moſt ſecret and impenetrable Truths; and to reſolve Queſtions, which depend upon ſo great number of Relations, that the moſt quick and penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Mind cannot diſcover them with any abſolute certainty, but after many Ages, and almoſt an infinity of Experiments.</p>
                     <p>There are a great number of Queſtions of this Nature in Phyſicks and Morality. All Sciences of Bodies and their Qualities, (as of Animals, Plants, Metals, and of their reſpective Qualities) are Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which can never be ſufficiently evident nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, eſpecially if they be not manag'd after another Method than heretofore; or if we begin not by the moſt Simple and leaſt compounded Sciences upon which they depend.

To know this, it's neceſſary to underſtand in what conſiſts the Whiteneſs of Hairs in particular, the Humours with which they are nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Philtres through which theſe Humours paſs, the Conformation, and the Root of the Hairs, or the Skin through which they paſs, and the difference of all theſe things in a Young and an Old Man, which it's abſolutely impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult to know.</p>

Averroes</hi> ought to have added, That Divine Providence gave us <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to teach us what was impoſſible to be known. For it's true, that this Philoſopher does not only teach us things which may be known, but if, ſince he muſt be believ'd upon his word, his Doctrine be the <hi>Soveraign Truth, Summa Veritas,</hi> he alſo teaches us thoſe things which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be known.</p>
                     <p>Certainly one muſt have much Faith, thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> when he gives us only Logical Reaſons, and only explains the Effects of Nature, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Notions of the Senſes; eſpecially ſince he boldly decides Queſtions which will never be reſolv'd by other Men. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> takes a particular Care to inform us, that we muſt believe him upon his word; for 'tis an inconteſtable Axiom with this Author, that the Diſciple muſt believe, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>It is true, that Diſciples are ſometimes oblig'd to believe their Maſter, but their Faith ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended only to Experiments and Matter of Fact; for if they intend to become true Philoſophers, they muſt examine the Reaſons of their Maſters, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them only when they diſcover the Evidence of them by their own Judgment. But to be a Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick, it is abſolutely neceſſary to believe and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and the ſame Diſpoſition of Mind ought to be had at the reading of that Philoſophy, as at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Hiſtory; for if any one takes the Liberty of making uſe of his Judgment and Reaſon, he muſt not

                     <p>But the reaſon why <hi>Ariſtetle,</hi> and many other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, have pretended to know what can never be known, is, That they have never known the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt Knowing and Knowing; betwixt having a certain and evident Knowledge, and having but a probable one: And the reaſon why they never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this difference, is, That the Subjects to which they applied themſelves, being beyond the perfect reach of their Mind, they ſaw but a part of them without being able to comprehend them all together; which indeed is enough to diſcover many Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but not to diſcover Truth evidently. Beſides, they ſeeking after Science meerly out of Vanity, and probabilities being more apt to gain the Eſteem of Men than Truth it ſelf, becauſe they are more proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated to the common reach of the Mind, they have neglected to ſeek after neceſſary Means to increaſe the Capacity of the Mind, and to give it more Extenſion than it has; ſo that they have not been able to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the bottom of Truths that are but a little hidden.</p>

What I ſay appears from this, That thoſe Perſons have not undertaken the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of very compound Difficulties, before they knew clearly the more Simple on which they depend. They did not apply themſelves to the Conſideration of Lines, as Conick Sections, until they were Maſters of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Geometry.</p>
                     <p>But that which is particular to Algebraiſts,

                        </note> is, That they ſee their Mind cannot be at the ſame time applied to many Figures, they cannot imagine Solicts that have more than three Dimenſions, although it's often neceſſary to conceive they may have more; they make uſe of Common and very Familiar Letters to expreſs and abridge their Idea's: Thus the mind not being
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60613:169"/>embarraſſed nor imploy'd upon any Repreſentation which it would be oblig'd to make upon many Figures and Lines, it may perceive at one view, all that it is capable of ſeeing otherwiſe. And thus the Mind can penetrate deeper, and extend it ſelf much farther when its Capacity is well manag'd.</p>
                     <p>The Art of rendring the Mind more penetrating and Extenſive, conſiſts, as we have elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, in a good Management of its Powers and Capacity, not in imploying it to no purpoſe upon things which are not neceſſary to diſcover the Truth it ſeeks after, which ought to be well obſerv'd.
<note place="margin">Book VI. <hi>The Second Part of Method.</hi>
                        </note> For this only ſhows, that common Logicks are fitter to leſſen the Capacity of the Mind than to inlarge it; becauſe it is evident, That if in a Search after any Truth, we uſe the Rules they preſcribe us, the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Mind is divided, ſo that it will be unfit to be attentive, and to apprehend all the Extenſion of the Subject it examines.</p>
                     <p>It is therefore ſufficiently evident from what I have ſaid, That the greateſt part of Men make but little Reflection upon the Nature of the Mind, whilſt they apply themſelves to a Search after Truth; for indeed they have never been well convinc'd of its little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and the neceſſity there is of well managing and enlarging it. And this is one of the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Cauſes of their Errors, and from hence it is that they have ſo unhappily perfected their Studies.</p>
                     <p>But we do not pretend that there were ever any Men, which were not conſcious of their own Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their little Capacity and Extenſion of Mind; all the World confeſſes it, but the Generality of them only know it confuſedly, and confeſs it only with their Mouths.

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Mind of Man is not only ſubject to Error becauſe it is Finite, or more limited than the Objects they conſider, as has been explained in the two precedent Chapters; but alſo becauſe it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and has no Firmneſs in whatſoever it does, and cannot keep it ſelf fix'd long enough upon any Subject, to examine it entirely.</p>
                     <p>To conceive the Cauſe of this Inconſtancy and Levity of our Minds, it is neceſſary to know, that its Action is directed by the Will; which applies it to ſuch Objects as it loves, and is of it ſelf continually Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and unſettled, of which this is the Cauſe.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60613:170"/>
                     <p>We cannot doubt but God is the Author of all things, that he hath made them for himſelf, and has inclined the Heart of Man towards him, by a Natural and Invincible Impreſſion that he continually imprints upon him. God cannot Will the Exiſtence of any Mind which cannot love him, or which ſhould love him leſs than any other Good, if any other beſides himſelf could be found; becauſe he cannot Will that any Mind ſhould not love that which is moſt Amiable, or love it more than that which is leſs Amiable.</p>
                     <p>Thus it is requiſite that a Natural Love ſhould carry us to God, ſince it comes from him; and that there is nothing that can ſtop the Motions of it, only God himſelf who imprinted them. Every bodies Will therefore neceſſarily follows the Motions of this Love. The Righteous and Wicked, the Happy and the Damned, Love God with this Love; for the Natural Love which we have for God, being the ſame thing as the Natural Inclination that carries us to Good in General, to the Infinite and Soveraign Good, it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that all Minds Love God with this Love, ſince he only is the Univerſal, Infinite, and Soveraign Good. For indeed all Spirits, and even the Devils, have an Ardent Deſire to be Happy, and to poſſeſs the Chief Good: And they deſire it without Choice, without Deliberation, without Liberty, and by a Neceſſity of their Nature. Being therefore made for God, for an Infinite Good, for a Good which comprehends all others in it, our Hearts can never be ſatisfied but by the Poſſeſſion of this Good.</p>
                     <p>Thus our Will always labouring under an eager Thirſt, always agitated with Deſires, Anxieties,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy of the Will, Cauſes the Defect of our Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſes our Error.</hi>
                        </note> and full of Inquietudes for the Good that it does not poſſeſs, cannot without much Pain ſuffer the Mind for any time to ſtop at abſtracted Truths, which affect it not, and which it judges uncapable of making it Happy. Thus ſhe Inceſſantly puſhes it forward to ſearch after other Objects, and when in this Agitation, which the Will communicates to it, it meets with any Object, that has the Appearance of a Good, I mean, ſuch as makes the Soul Senſible of any Pleaſure, or inward
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60613:171"/>Satisfaction at its approach; then this Thirſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited anew; theſe Deſires, theſe wiſhes, and theſe Ardours, take new Life; and the Mind being oblig'd to obey them, engages it ſelf only to that Object, which cauſes or ſeems to cauſe them, to draw it nearer to the Soul which taſts it, and feeds on it for ſome time. But the Emptineſs of Creatures cannot fill the Infinite Capacity of Man's Mind; theſe little Pleaſures irritate its Thirſt rather than allay it, and give the Soul a vain ſort of a Hope of being ſatisfied in the Multiplicity of the Pleaſures of this Life; which alſo produces an Inconſtancy and an inconceivable Levity in the Mind, which was to diſcover to it all theſe Goods.</p>
                     <p>It's true, that when the Mind accidentally meets with any Object which is related to Infinity, and which includes in it ſelf ſome great thing, its Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and Agitation ceaſes for ſome time; for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering this Object to bear the Character of what the Soul deſires, it joyns and adheres to it for a long time. But this Adheſion, or rather this Prejudice of the Mind, to examine Subjects that are Infinite or very great, is as uſeleſs to it, as that Levity with which it conſiders things that are proportion'd to its Capacity; it is too weak to finiſh ſo difficult an Enterpriſe, and it is vain to force it ſelf to accompliſh it. The Comprehenſion of an Infinite Object, if I may ſo ſay, cannot render the Soul Happy, it is incapable of it, but the Love and Enjoyment of an Infinite Good may do it, whereof the Will is capable, by the Motion of that Love which God continually impreſſes upon it.</p>
                     <p>After this we muſt not be ſurpriſed at the Ignorance and Blindneſs of Men, ſince their Mind being ſubject to the Inconſtancy and Levity of their Heart, which renders it incapable of conſidering any thing with a Serious Application, it cannot penetrate into any thing which includes ſome conſiderable Difficulty. For, in fine, the Attention of the Mind to the Objects of the Mind, is the ſame thing as fixing our Eyes upon the Objects of our Eyes; even as a Man who cannot fix his Eyes upon Objects that are about him, cannot ſee
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60613:171"/>clearly enough to diſtinguiſh the Differences of their leaſt Parts, and to know all the relations theſe little parts have with each other: So a Man who cannot fix the Eyes of his Mind upon things which he would know, cannot ſufficiently know them to diſtinguiſh all their Parts, and to know all the Relations which they may have among themſelves, or to other Subjects.</p>
                     <p>However 'tis evident, That all Knowledge conſiſts only in a clear View of the Relations that things have to one another: Therefore when it happens, as in difficult Queſtions, that the Mind muſt ſee at one view, a great Number of Relations which two or more things have amongſt themſelves, it's evident, That if it has not conſider'd theſe things with much Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and only knows them confuſedly, it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for it to perceive diſtinctly their Relations, and conſequently to form a ſolid Judgment of them.</p>
                     <p>One of the chief Cauſes of the Want of Application of Mind to abſtracted Truths, is,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Our Senſations affect us more than the Pure Idea's of the Mind.</hi>
                        </note> That we ſee them at a diſtance; and things which are nearer, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually repreſented to our Mind; a great Attention of Mind approaches, if I may ſo ſay, to the Idea's of Objects with which it is affected. But it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, that when we are Attentive upon Metaphyſical Speculations, we are diverted from them, becauſe ſome Senſation comes upon the Soul which is nearer to it than thoſe Idea's; the leaſt Pain or Pleaſure is ſufficient to effect this; the reaſon of it is, Pain and Pleaſure, and generally all Senſations, are within the Soul it ſelf, they modifie and affect it, much nearer than the ſimple Idea's of Objects of Pure Intellection, which though preſent to the Mind do not modifie it. Thus the Soul being on the one hand very narrow, and on the other, not being able to hinder Pain, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and other Senſations,
<note place="margin">See Ch. 7. Second Part of this Book.</note> its Capacity is fill'd with them; and it cannot at the ſame time be Senſible of any thing, and think freely of other things of which it cannot be Senſible. The Buzzing of a Fly, or ſome other little Noiſe, ſuppoſing it to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated even to the chief part of the Brain, ſo that the Soul perceives it, is capable, notwithſtanding all our
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60613:172"/>Efforts to the contrary, of hindering us from conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering abſtracted and elevated Truths, becauſe all abſtracted Idea's do not modifie the Soul, though all Senſations do.

                     </p>
                     <p>'Tis this that cauſes a Stupidity and Dullneſs of Mind, in reſpect of the great Truths of Chriſtian Morality; hence it is that Men only know them after a Speculative and Unfruitful Manner, without the Grace of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All the World knows that there is a God, that he muſt be Ador'd and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped; but who is it that Serves and Worſhips him without Grace, which makes us taſte a Sweetneſs and Pleaſure in all our Duties? There are very few who are not Senſible of the Emptineſs and Inſtability of the Goods of this World, and even who are not touch'd with an abſtracted, yet always with a very certain and evident Conviction, that they deſerve not our Application and Concern. But where are thoſe that Practically Deſpiſe theſe Goods? and who are not Anxious and Careful to obtain them? 'Tis thoſe only who perceive ſome Bitterneſs and Diſguſt in their Enjoyment, or elſe by the Grace of God are made Senſible of Spiritual Good by an inward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light which God hath joyn'd to them, who overcome the Impreſſions of their Senſes and the Efforts of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence. The bare Contemplation of the Mind, does not therefore make us ever reſiſt the Efforts of Concupiſcence as we ought to do; an Internal Motion of the Heart muſt alſo ſecond it. This Light of the Mind only is, as ſome ſay, a <hi>Sufficient Grace,</hi> which enables us to Condemn our ſelves, and informs us of our Weakneſs, and that we ought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by Prayer to him who is our Power. But this inward Sentiment of Heart is a <hi>Lively Grace</hi> which operates, 'tis this which affects and fills us, which perſwades the Heart, and without there is no one can think heartily, <hi>Nemo eſt qui cogitet corde.</hi> All the moſt conſtant Truths of Morality lie hid in the Secret Receſſes and Windings of the Mind, and ſo long as they ſtay there, are Barren, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Power, ſince the Soul does not taſte them.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60613:172"/>But the Pleaſures of the Senſes are nearer the Soul, and it being impoſſible that it ſhould not be ſenſible of, and love its
<note n="*" place="margin">With a Natural Love, for one may hate Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with a Hatred of choice.</note> Pleaſure, it's impoſſible to be freed from the World,

                     <p>However I do not yet deny that the Righteous, whoſe Heart hath been livelily turn'd towards God by prepoſſeſſed Delight, cannot without this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Grace, do ſome deſerving Actions, aad reſiſt the Motions of Concupiſcence; there are ſome that are Generous and Conſtant in the Law of God, by the Power of their Faith, by an aſſiduous Privation of ſenſible things, and by a Contempt and Diſguſt of all Temptations. There are ſome who act for the moſt part without taſting preventing and unthought of Pleaſure; the only Joy which they find in acting Piouſly, is the Pleaſure alone they are ſenſible of, and this Pleaſure is ſufficient to ſtay them in that Eſtate, and to confirm the Diſpoſition of their Heart. Thoſe who begin their Converſion, have commonly need of a prepoſſeſſed and an indeliberate Pleaſure, to free them from their Senſible Goods, to which they are united by other preventing and indeliberate Pleaſures. Sadneſs and Remorſe of Conſcience is not enough, and they do not yet taſte any Joy: But the Juſt can live by Faith and in Want; and it's even in this Condition that they deſerve more; becauſe Men being reaſonable, God will be lov'd by them with a Love of Choice, rather than with a Love of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and an indeliberate Love; like that by which they love Senſible things, without knowing them to be Good, otherwiſe than by the Pleaſure which they receive from them. However, the greateſt part of Men have little Faith, and being continually led to taſte Pleaſure, they cannot long preſerve their elective Love for God, againſt a Natural Love for Senſible Goods, if their Delight in Grace does not uphold them againſt the Efforts of Pleaſure; for a Delight in Grace, begets, preſerves, and increaſes Charity, as Senſible Pleaſures do Deſire.</p>

                     <p>It is evident from what has been ſaid,
<note place="margin">V. <hi>Of Mens Ignorance.</hi>
                        </note> That Men being never without ſome Paſſion, or agreeable or diſagreeable Senſations; much of the Capacity and Extenſion of their Mind is taken up with them: And when they are willing to employ the reſt of their Capacity to examine ſome Truth, they are often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by ſome new Senſations, or by a Diſguſt which they find in this Exerciſe; and by an Inconſtancy of the Will, which agitates and runs the Mind from one Object to another; ſo that unleſs they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd themſelves to overcome theſe Oppoſitions from their Youth, as has been explain'd in the Second Part, they will at laſt be incapable of penetrating into any thing that is a little Difficult, or which requires a little Application.</p>
                     <p>We muſt then conclude, That all Sciences, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that include Queſtions very difficult to be reſolv'd, are full of an infinite Number of Errors; and that we ought to ſuſpect all thoſe great Volumes, which are every day compoſed upon Phyſicks, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy, and Morality; and eſpecially upon the particular Propoſitions of theſe Sciences, which are much more compounded than general ones. We ought even to judge, that theſe Books are ſo much the more to be Contemned, as they are better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the generality of Men; I mean, thoſe who are but little capable of Application, and who know not how to make a good uſe of their Judgment; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Applauſe of the Vulgar, in any difficult Matter, is a certain Argument of the Falſity of that Opinion, and that it is only maintained upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive Notions of the Senſes, or ſome falſe Lights of the Imagination.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is not impoſſible, but that a Man may of himſelf diſcover a greater Number of Truths which have been conceal'd from former Ages, provided he does not want a good Judgment, but lives in ſome retired place, where nothing can divert him, if he Seriouſly apply himſelf to an enquiry into Truth.</p>

                     <p>Yet I adviſe them not to ſtop at this Prejudice, nor to believe that <hi>Deſcartes</hi> is a great Man, and that his Philoſophy is good, becauſe he may be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageouſly ſpoke of: <hi>Deſcartes</hi> was a Man ſubject to Error, and miſtakes like others: There are none of his Works, even not excepting his Geometry, wherein there are not ſome Footſteps of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Humane Mind: He muſt not therefore be believ'd upon his Word, but be read with Precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he himſelf adviſes us to do; examining if he was not deceiv'd, and believing nothing of what he ſays, but what Evidence, and the Secret Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of our Reaſon oblige us to believe; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Mind knows nothing truly, but what it ſees evidently.</p>
                     <p>We have ſhown in the preceding Chapters, that our Mind is not infinite; but on the contrary, that it had a very mean Capacity, which is commonly filled with the Senſations of the Soul. And laſtly, That the Mind receiving its Direction from the Will, cannot firmly conſider any Object, without being ſoon diverted from it, through its Inconſtancy and Levity. Theſe things are certainly the moſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60613:174"/>general Cauſes of our Errors, and we might longer inſiſt upon them here, but what I have ſaid, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to diſcover the Weakneſs of the Humane Mind, to Perſons that are capable of any Attention. In the Fourth and Fifth Book we ſhall treat more largely of the Errors which our Inclinations and Paſſions lead us into, and of which we have already ſaid ſomething in this Chapter.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I Think every one will confeſs, that we do not perceive External Objects by themſelves. We ſee the Sun, the Stars, and many Objects without us; and it is not probable that the Soul ſhould go out of the Body, and walk as it were, through the Heavens, to Contemplate all thoſe Objects there. She does not then ſee them by themſelves, and as the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Object of Mind; when it ſees the Sun, for inſtance, it is not the Sun, but ſomething which is nearly united to our Soul; and it is that which I call Idea: So that here by this word <hi>Idea,</hi> I mean only what
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60613:175"/>is the immediate Object, or the neareſt the Mind when it perceives any thing.</p>
                     <p>It muſt be obſerved, that to make the Mind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Object, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Idea of this Object ſhould be actually preſent, of which we can have no doubt; but it is not requiſite that there ſhould be ſome external Object which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles this Idea; for it often happens, that we perceive things which are not, and which never had a being. So that we often have in our Minds real Idea's of things which never were. For inſtance, when a Man imagins a Mountain of Gold, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Idea of this Mountain ſhould be really preſent to his Mind: When a Mad Man, a Man in a high Fever, or a Man that is aſleep, ſees any terrible Animal before his Eyes, it is certain that the Idea of this Animal truly Exiſts; and yet this Mountain of Gold, and this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, never were.</p>
                     <p>However, Men being Naturally inclined to believe that there is none but Corporeal Objects which Exiſt, they Judge of the Reality and Exiſtence of things quite after another manner than they ought to do; for as ſoon as they are ſenſible of any Object, they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have it that this Object Exiſts, although it often happens, that there is nothing without: And further, they affirm, that this Object is exactly the ſame as they ſee it, which never happens. But in reſpect to the Idea which neceſſarily Exiſts, and which can be nothing elſe beſides what it appears to be, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reflection, commonly Judge it to be nothing; as if Idea's had not a very great number of Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: As if the Idea's of a Square, for inſtance, was not very different from that of ſome number, and did not repreſent things perfectly diſtinct; which could never happen to nothing, ſince nothing has no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. It is therefore indiſputable, that Idea's have a real Exiſtence. But let us examine their Nature and Eſſence, and ſee what it can be in the Soul that is capable of repreſenting all things.</p>
                     <p>Whatever things the Soul perceives, are either in, or out of its ſelf, thoſe which are in the Soul, are its
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60613:175"/>own thoughts; that is, all its different Modifications; for by theſe words, <hi>Thought, manner of Thinking, or modification of the Soul,</hi> I underſtand in general all things, that can be in the Soul without her perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as her own Senſations, Imaginations, pure Intellections, or ſimple Conceptions, even her Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Natural Inclinations. Now our Soul has no need of Idea's to perceive all theſe things, becauſe they are within the Soul; or rather, the Soul it ſelf, after ſuch or ſuch a manner: Even as the real round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome Body, and its Motion, are only this Body Figured, and moved after ſuch or ſuch a manner.</p>
                     <p>But as for things that are out of the Soul, we can perceive them only by the means of Idea's, ſuppoſing that theſe things cannot be intimately united to it. There are two ſorts of them, Spiritual, and Material: As for the Spiritual, there is ſome probability that they may diſcover themſelves to the Soul without Idea's, and by themſelves. For although Experience teaches us, that we cannot immediately, and of our ſelves, declare our Thoughts to one another, but only by words, or ſome other ſenſible Sign, to which we have aſſixed our Idea's: We may ſay, that God has ordained it ſo only during this Life, to hinder thoſe Diſorders that would ſoon happen, if Men could make themſelves be underſtood as they pleaſed. But when Juſtice and Order ſhall Reign, and we ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the Captivity of our Bodies, we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make our ſelves mutually underſtood by an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Union of our ſelves, as its probable the Angels do in Heaven; ſo that it does not ſeem abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to admit Idea's to repreſent ſpiritual things to the Soul, becauſe it may be, we may ſee them by themſelves, although after a very imperfect manner.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I examine not here how two Spirits can be united one to the other, and if they can after this manner mutually diſcover one anothers Thoughts. I believe however, that there is no Subſtance purely intelligible, but that of God; nothing can be evidently known but in his Light; and that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Spirits cannot make them Viſible: For although we are moſt ſtrictly united to our ſelves, we are,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60613:176"/>and ſhall be unintelligible to our ſelves, until we ſee our ſelves in God; and that he repreſents to us the perfect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Idea that he hath of our being included in his. So that although I may ſeem here to grant, that Angels can manifeſt one to another what they are, and what they think; 'tis only becauſe I will not diſpute of it, provided I am granted what is not to be doubted,</hi> viz. <hi>That we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee material things by themſelves, and without Idea's.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I ſhall explain in the Seventh Chapter, my Opinion how we know Spirits; and will ſhew, that at preſent we cannot abſolutely know them by themſelves, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be they are united to us. But I ſpeak here chieſly of material things, which certainly cannot be united to the Soul, in ſuch a manner as is neceſſary for us to perceive them: Becauſe being extended, and the Soul not, there is no proportion between them. Beſides, our Souls go not out of our Bodies to meaſure the greatneſs of the Heaven, and conſequently, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee External Bodies, but by the Idea's which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them. This is what all the World ought to grant.</p>
                     <p>We are aſſured then,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>A divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ſeveral ways whereby External Objects may be ſeen.</hi>
                        </note> that it's abſolutely neceſſary, that the Idea's we have of Bodies, and of all other Objects which we perceive not by themſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from theſe Bodies, or theſe Objects; or elſe that our Soul has the power of producing theſe Idea's, or that God Created them with our Souls; or that he produces them every time that we think of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; or elſe that the Soul has all thoſe Perfections in it ſelf that it ſees in theſe Bodies: Or in fine, that it is united with a perfect Being, which in general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the Perfections of Created Beings.</p>
                     <p>We cannot ſee Objects but after one of theſe ways: Let us examin without prejudice, and without fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves with the difficulty of the Queſtion, which of them ſeems moſt probable: It may be we may reſolve it very clearly, although we do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend here to give ſuch Demonſtrations as will ſatisfie all ſorts of perſons; but only convincing Proofs to thoſe at leaſt, as will meditate with ſerious Attention upon them; for perhaps it would be thought too raſh if we ſhould pretend otherwiſe.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe moſt common received Opinion is that of the Peripateticks, who think that External Objects emit Species which reſemble them, and that thoſe Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are carried by the External Senſes to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe or Underſtanding. They call theſe Species <hi>impreſſed,</hi> becauſe the Object imprints them on the External Senſes. Theſe <hi>impreſſed</hi> Species being Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial and Senſible, are render'd intelligible, by means of the <hi>active,</hi> or <hi>active intellect;</hi> and are fit to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the <hi>paſſive intellect.</hi> Theſe Species thus ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualiz'd, are called <hi>expreſs'd</hi> Species, becauſe they are expreſs'd by the impreſs'd ones; and 'tis by them that the Paſſive Intellect knows all material things.</p>
                     <p>We ſhall not ſtay to explain at large theſe ſine things, and the divers manners in which different Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers conceive them; for although they do not agree as to the number of Faculties which they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Interior Senſe, and the Underſtanding; and though there are not a few, who doubt whether they have need of any <hi>active Intellect,</hi> to know ſenſible Objects, yet however they generally agree, that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Objects emit the Species or Images which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them. And 'tis only upon this Foundation that they multiply their Faculties, and defend their <hi>active intellect:</hi> So that this Foundation having no So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity, as ſhall ſoon be ſhewn, it will be unneceſſary to ſpend any time to overturn the Superſtructure.</p>
                     <p>We are aſſur'd then, that it is improbable that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould emit their Images, or Species which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them, for theſe reaſons. 1. From the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrability of Objects: All Objects, as the Sun, Stars, and all ſuch as are near the Eyes, cannot emit Species which are different from their reſpective Natures: Wherefore Philoſophers commonly ſay, that theſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60613:177"/>Species are Groſs and Material, in which they differ from <hi>expreſs'd</hi> Species which are Spiritualiſed. Theſe impreſs'd Species of Objects then are little Bodies, they cannot therefore be penetrated, nor all the Spaces which are betwixt the Earth and the Heaven, which muſt be full of them. Whence it's eaſie to conclude, they muſt be bruis'd and broken, in moving every way; and thus they cannot render Objects viſible.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, one may ſee from the ſame place or point, a great number of Objects in the Heavens, and on the Earth; therefore the Species of theſe Objects can be reduc'd into a Point. But they are impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable ſince they are extended, Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But one may not only ſee a multitude of very great and vaſt Objects: There is no Point in all the great Spaces of the World, from whence we cannot diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver an almoſt infinite number of Objects, and even Objects as large as the Sun, Moon, and the Heavens, there is therefore no Point in all the World where the Species of all theſe things ought not to meet; which is againſt all appearance of Truth.</p>
                     <p>The Second Reaſon is taken from the Change which happens in the Species;
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Such as would know how all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Viſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catedwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being weaken'd, may read Monſicur</hi> Deſcartes <hi>his Diop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricks.</hi>
                        </note> it's evident, that the nearer any Object is, the greater its Species ought to be, ſince we ſee the Object's greater. But what is yet more difficult to conceive, according to their Opinion, is, That if we look upon this Object with a Teleſcope, or a Microſcope, the Species immediately becomes Six Hundred times as great as it was before; for 'tis yet more difficultly conceiv'd from what Parts it can grow ſo great in an inſtant.</p>
                     <p>The Third Reaſon is, when we look upon a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cube, all the Species of its Sides are unequal; nevertheleſs, we ſee all the Sides equally Square. So when we conſider Ellipſes and Parallelograms in a Picture, which cannot but emit like Species, yet we ſee Circles and Squares: This manifeſtly ſhews, that it is not neceſſary that the Object beheld, ſhould emit Species like it ſelf, that it may be ſeen.</p>
                     <p>In fine, it cannot be conceiv'd how it can be, that a Body, which does not ſenſibly diminiſh, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60613:177"/>emit Species on every Side, which ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually fill all the great Spaces about it, and that with an inconceivable ſwiftneſs. For an Object that was hidden, in that Inſtant that it diſcovers it ſelf may be ſeen many Millions of Leagues on all Sides; and what appears yet more ſtrange is, that Bodies in great Motion, as Air, and ſome others, have not that power of puſhing outwards theſe Images which reſemble them; as the more groſs and quieſcent Bodies, ſuch as the Earth, Stones, and generally all hard Bodies have.</p>
                     <p>But I ſhall not ſtay any longer to enumerate all the contrary Reaſons to their Opinion, there would be no end, a very ordinary Judgment would raiſe innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Objections. Thoſe that we have brought are ſufficient, though they were not ſo neceſſary after what has been ſaid upon the Subject of the Firſt Book, where the Errors of the Senſes were explain'd. But there are ſo great a number of Philoſophers wedded to this Opinion, that we believe it will be neceſſary to ſay ſomething to encline them to reflect upon their own Thoughts.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Second Opinion is that of thoſe who believe our Souls have any power of producing the Idea's of ſuch things as they will think upon, and they are excited to produce them by the Impreſſions which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects make upon Bodies, although theſe Impreſſions are not Images like the Objects which cauſe them; they believe that 'tis in this, that Man is made after the Image of God, and participates of his Power, That even as God Created all things out of nothing,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60613:178"/>and can reduce them to nothing again, and then Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them anew; ſo Man can Create, and Annihilate the Idea's of all things as he pleaſes. But there is great Reaſons to diſtruſt all theſe Opinions which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol a Man, theſe are the Common Thoughts which ariſe from a vain and proud Original, and which the Father of Light hath not inſpir'd.</p>
                     <p>This participation of the power of God which Men boaſt of having, to repreſent Objects, and of doing many other particular actions, is a participation which ſeems to relate to ſomething of independance, as independance is commonly explain'd; it is alſo a Chimerical Participation, which Mens Ignorance and Vanity make them to imagine. They depend much more than they think, upon the Goodneſs and Mercy of God: But this is not a place to explain theſe things. It's enough if we endeavour to ſhew, that Men have not the Power of forming the Idea's of things which they perceive.</p>
                     <p>No one can doubt that Idea's are real Beings, ſince they have real Properties, ſince they differ from one another, and repreſent all different things; Nor can we reaſonably doubt that they are Spiritual, and very different from the Bodies which they repreſent. But it ſeems reaſonable to doubt, whether Idea's, by whoſe means we ſee Bodies, are not more Noble than the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies themſelves: for indeed the Intelligible World muſt be more perfect than the Material and Earthly, as we ſhall ſee hereafter. Thus when we affirm that we have the Power of Forming ſuch Idea's as we pleaſe, we ſhall be in danger of perſwading our ſelves, to make more Noble and Perfect Beings, than the World which God hath Created. However, ſome do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon it, becauſe they imagin that an Idea is Nothing, ſince it is not to be felt; or elſe if they look upon it as a Being, 'tis a very mean, contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble one, becauſe they imagin it to be annihilated as ſoon as it is no longer preſent to the Mind.</p>
                     <p>But ſuppoſing it true, that Idea's were only little contemptible Beings, yet they are Beings, and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Ones; and Men not having the power of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60613:178"/>it follows that they cannot produce them; for the production of Idea's after the manner before explain'd, is a true Creation; and although Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to palliate and mollifie the hardneſs of this Opinion, by ſaying, that the production of Idea's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes ſomething elſe, but Creation nothing; yet the difficulty is not ſolv'd by this Subterfuge.</p>
                     <p>For we ought to conſider, that it is not more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to produce ſomething out of nothing, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one thing out of another; which cannot at all contribute to its Production. For example, it is not more difficult to Create an Angel, than to produce him from a Stone; becauſe a Stone being of another ſort of Being wholly different, it cannot in the leaſt be uſeful to the Production of an Angel. But it may contribute to the Production of Bread, Gold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a Stone, Gold, and Bread, are but the ſame thing differently configur'd, and are all Material.</p>
                     <p>It is even more difficult to produce an Angel of a Stone, than to pronuce him out of nothing; becauſe to make an Angel out of a Stone; (ſo far as it can be done) the Stone muſt be annihilated, and afterwards the Angel Created; But ſimply to Create an Angel, nothing is to be annihilated. If therefore the Mind produces its Idea's from the material Impreſſions which the Brain receives from Objects, it muſt always do the ſame thing, or a thing as difficult, or even more difficult than if it Created them; ſince Idea's being Spiritual, they cannot be produc'd of material Images, which have no proportion with them.</p>
                     <p>But if it be ſaid, that an Idea is not a Subſtance, I conſent to it, yet it is always ſomething that is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and as it is impoſſible to make a Square of a Spirit, although a Square be not a Subſtance, ſo it is alſo impoſſible to Form a Material Subſtance from a Spiritual Idea, although an Idea was no Subſtance.</p>
                     <p>But although we ſhould grant to the Mind of Man a Soveraign Power to Annihilate, and Create the Idea's of things, yet it would never make uſe of that Power to produce them; for even as a Painter, how skilful ſoever he be, could not repreſent an Animal
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60613:179"/>which he had never ſeen, and of which he never had any Idea: So that the Picture which he ſhould make, ſhould be like to this unknown Animal. Thus a Man cannot form the Idea of an Object, if he knew it not before, that is, if he has not already had ſome Idea of it, which does not depend upon his Will; and if he already had an Idea of it, he certainly knows this Object, and it would be unneceſſary for him to Form it anew. It is therefore in vain to attribute to the Mind of Man the Power of producing his Idea's. It might be ſaid perhaps, that the Mind of Man hath general and confuſed Idea's which it does not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce; and that thoſe which it produces are particular, more clear and diſtinct; but it is always the ſame thing. For even as a Painter cannot draw the Picture of a particular Perſon, ſo as to be ſure that he hath perfected it, if he had had no diſtinct Idea of him; and even if the Perſon had not been preſent: Thus the Mind, for example, which could only have the Idea of a Being, or an Animal in general, could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to its ſelf a Horſe, nor Form a diſtinct Idea of one, and be aſſured that it is perfectly like a Horſe, if it had not already the firſt Idea with which it might compare this ſecond: Now if it had a firſt, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful to Form a ſecond; and the Queſtion reſpects this firſt. Therefore, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It's true, that when we conceive a Square by pure Intellection, we can alſo imagin it, that is, perceive it in our ſelves, by tracing an Image of it in the Brain; yet it muſt be firſt obſerv'd, that we are not the true nor principal Cauſe of this Image: But it will be too long to explain it here. Secondly, So far is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Idea which accompanies this Image, from being more diſtinct and more exact than the other, that on the contrary, it is not ſo Exact, becauſe it reſembles the firſt, which was only a pattern for the ſecond. For indeed we muſt not believe that the Imagination and Senſes repreſent Objects more diſtinctly to us than the pure Underſtanding; but only that they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them more to the Mind; for the Idea's of the Senſes and Imagination are not diſtinct, but only ſo
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60613:179"/>far as they are conformable to the pure Intellection: The Image of a Square for example, which the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination Traces in the Brain, is not exact and perfect, but only ſo far as it reſembles the Idea of the Square, which we conceive by pure Intellection. It is this Idea which regulates this Image, 'tis the Mind which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts the Imagination; and which Obliges it, if we may ſo ſay, to behold from time to time, whether the Image it Paints, be a Figure of four right and equal Lines, whoſe Angles are alike. In a word, whether what it Imagins, is like to what it Conceives.</p>
                     <p>After what has been ſaid,

That makes all the World conclude, that a Bowl put in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and meeting another, is the true and principal Cauſe of the Motion that it communicates to it; as the Will of the Soul is the true and principal Cauſe of the Motion of the Arm, and other the like prejudices; becauſe it always happens, that a Bowl is ſhaken when it is met by another that runs againſt it: As our Arms are moved almoſt always when we Will, and we do not ſee any other apparent Cauſe of this Motion.</p>
                     <p>But when an Effect does not ſo often follow ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which is not the Cauſe of it, there is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a great many Men, who believe this thing is the Cauſe of the Effect which happens.; yet every Body is not guilty of the ſame Error. For inſtance, if a Comet appears, and after this Comet a Prince Dies: Some Stones lie expoſed to the Moon, and they are eaten with Worms: The Sun is joined with Mars at the Nativity of a Child, and ſomething extraordinary happens to this Child: All this is enough to perſwade a great many Men, that the Comet, the Moon, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60613:180"/>the Conjunction of the Sun with Mars, are the Cauſes of theſe Effects, and others like them; and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why all the World does not believe it, is, that they do not always ſee theſe Effects follow theſe Cauſes.</p>
                     <p>But all Men having commonly the Idea's of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects preſent to their Minds as ſoon as they wiſh it, and it happening many times in a day, almoſt all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the Will which accompanies the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or rather the preſence of Idea's, is truly the Cauſe of them: Becauſe they ſee nothing in the ſame time that they can attribute it to; and they imagin the Idea's no longer Exiſt, when the Mind ſees them no longer; and that they revive again anew, when they are again repreſented to the Mind.</p>
                     <p>'Tis for theſe Reaſons ſome Judge, that External Objects emit Images which reſemble them, as we have mention'd in the precedent Chapter: For it being impoſſible to ſee Objects by themſelves, but only by their Idea's, they judge the Object produces the Idea; becauſe as ſoon as it is preſent they ſee it; and as ſoon as abſent they ſee it no longer; and becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Object almoſt always accompanies the Idea which repreſents it to us.</p>
                     <p>Yet if Men were not prejudiced in their Judgments from this, that the Idea's of things are preſent to their Mind as ſoon as they Will them, they ſhould only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that according to the Order of Nature, their Will is commonly neceſſary for them to have thoſe Idea's. Not that the Will is the true and principal Cauſe which preſents them to the Mind, and much leſs, that the Will produces them from nothing, or after the manner they explain it. Nor ought they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Objects emit Species reſembling them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Soul commonly perceives them only when they are preſent; but only that the Object is for the moſt part neceſſary, in order to the Idea's being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Mind. And laſtly, that a Bowl put into Motion, is the principal and true Cauſe of the ſhaking of another Bowl that it meets in the way, ſince the firſt had not the power of Motion in its ſelf. They can only determin, that the meeting of two Bowls is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60613:180"/>an occaſion to the Author, of the Motion of Matter to execute the Decree of his Will, which is the Univerſal Cauſe of all things,

                           <hi>That we do not ſee Objects by the Means of Idea's which were created with us. And that God does not produce them in us ſo often as we have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Third Opinion is, That of thoſe who ſay all Idea's are created with us.</p>
                     <p>To diſcover the Improbability of this Opinion, it will be neceſſary to conſider that there is many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent things in the World of which we have Idea's. But to ſpeak only of ſimple Figures, it is certain that the Number of them is Infinite: Nay, even if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider but one only, as the Ellipſis, we cannot doubt but the Mind conceives an infinite Number of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Kinds of them, when it conſiders that one of the Diameters may be lengthened out to Infinity, and the other always continue the ſame.</p>
                     <p>So the heighth of a Triangle may be augmented or diminiſhed infinitely, the baſe being always the ſame, we may conceive there is an infinite Number of different Kinds of them: And alſo, which I deſire may be conſider'd here, The Mind in ſome manner perceives this infinite Number, although we can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but very few of them; and that we can at the ſame time have particular and diſtinct Idea's of many Triangles of different Kinds. But what muſt chiefly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60613:181"/>be obſerved is, That this general Idea that the Mind has of this Number of Triangles of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Kinds is ſufficient to prove, That if we do not conceive each of theſe different Triangles by particular Idea's: And in ſhort, If we comprehend not their Infinity, 'tis not the Defect of the Idea's, or that Infinity is not repreſented to us, but only the Defect of the Capacity and Extenſion of the Mind. If a Man ſhould apply himſelf to conſider the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of all the diverſe Kinds of Triangles, although he ſhould eternally continue this ſort of Study, he would never want new and particular Idea's, but his Mind would be unprofitably fatigued.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid of Triangles, may be applied to five, ſix, a hundred, a thouſand, or ten thouſand ſided Figures, and ſo on <hi>ad infinitum.</hi> Now if the ſides of a Triangle, which have infinite relations one with the other, make Triangles of infinite Kinds, it is plain that four, five, or a thouſand ſided Figures are capable of admitting much greater Differences, ſince they are capable of a greater Number of Relations and Combinations of their ſides, than ſimple Triangles are.</p>
                     <p>The Mind then ſees all theſe things; it hath Idea's of them; and theſe Idea's would never fail it, although it ſhould employ infinite Ages in the Conſideration of one Figure only: And if it perceived not theſe infinite Figures all of a ſudden, or comprehended not their Infinity, 'tis only becauſe its Extenſion is very much limited. It hath then an infinite Number of Idea's: Do I ſay an infinite Number? It hath as many infinite Numbers of Idea's, as there are different Figures to be conſider'd: So that ſince there is an infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of different Figures, it's neceſſary that to know the Figures, the Mind have an infinitely infinite Number of Idea's.</p>
                     <p>Now I ask, If it's probable that God ſhould Create ſo many things with the Mind of Man? For my part it does not appear ſo to me; chiefly, ſince that might be made in a more ſimple and eaſie manner, as we ſhall ſoon ſee. For as God always acts by the moſt ſimple
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60613:181"/>ways, it does not ſeem reaſonable to explain how we know Objects, by admitting the Creation of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Number of Beings, ſince we can reſolve this Difficulty in a more Eaſie and Natural way.</p>
                     <p>But although the Mind ſhould have a Magazine of all the Idea's, which are neceſſary for it to ſee things, it would be yet more difficult to explain how the Soul ſhould make choice of them to repreſent them: For inſtance, how it can repreſent the Sun to it ſelf, whilſt it is preſent to the Eyes of its Body?</p>
                     <p>For whereas the Image which the Sun imprints in the Brain, reſembles not the Idea we have thereof, as has been elſewhere proved; and ſince the Soul per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the Motion that the Sun produces in the bottom of the Eyes, and in the Brain, it's inconceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble how it ſhould exactly gueſs, amongſt theſe infinite Number of Idea's that it has, which it muſt repreſent to it ſelf, to imagine or to ſee the Sun: We cannot therefore ſay, That the Idea's of things were created with us, it is ſufficient that we ſee the Objects that are about us.</p>
                     <p>Nor can we ſay that God produces as many of them every Moment, as we perceive different things; this has been ſufficiently refuted from what has been ſaid in this Chapter. Beſides it is neceſſary that at all times we actually have in our ſelves the Idea's of all things, ſince we are always able to think of all things; which we could not if we perceiv'd them already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly; that is, If an infinite Number of Idea's were not preſent to our Minds; for we cannot will to think of Objects, of which we have no Idea.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>That the Mind neither ſees the Eſſence, nor Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of Objects, in conſidering its own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. That none but God ſees them in that manner.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Fourth Opinion is, That the Mind ſtands in need of nothing beſides it ſelf, to perceive Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and that it can, in conſidering it ſelf and its own Perfections, diſcover all things that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that the Soul ſees within it ſelf, and without Idea's, all the Senſations and Paſſions it is capable of, as Pleaſure, Pain, Cold, Heat, Colours, Sounds, Odours, Sapors, its Love, its Hatred, Joy and Sadneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe all the Senſations and Paſſions of the Soul repreſent nothing External which is like them; and becauſe they are only Modifications, which nothing but the Mind is capable of. But the Difficulty is, to know whether the Idea's which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſomething that is without the Soul, and which reſembles them in ſome meaſure, as the Idea's of a Sun, a Houſe, a Horſe, a River, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are only Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the Soul; inſomuch that the Soul cannot ſtand in need of any thing beſides it ſelf, to repreſent to it ſelf all External Things.</p>
                     <p>There are Perſons who make no Scruple to affirm, That the Soul being made to think, it has in it ſelf, I mean, in conſidering its own Perfections, whatever is neceſſary to perceive Objects; for indeed the Soul being nobler than all the things it conceives diſtinctly, it may be ſaid, that it contains them in ſome meaſure <hi>Eminently,</hi> according to the Notions of the Schools; that is, after a Nobler and more Sublime Manner than they are in themſelves. They pretend, that thus Superior things comprehend the Perfections of thoſe that are Inferior. And thus being the Nobleſt of the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60613:182"/>Creatures they know; they fancy they have in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, after a Spiritual Manner, all that is in the viſible World. In a word, They will have the Soul to be like an Intelligible World, which comprehends in it ſelf, whatever the Material and Senſible World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends; nay, Infinitely more.</p>
                     <p>But in my Opinion it is a great Preſumption to maintain that Thought: If I am not miſtaken, it is Natural Vanity, the Love of Independence, and the Deſire of reſembling him who comprehends all Beings in himſelf, which Confounds the Mind,

                        </note> and inclines us to believe, we poſſeſs what we have not: <hi>Do not ſay that you are a Light to your ſelf,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> for there is none but God who is a Light to himſelf, and who can, in conſidering himſelf, ſee whatever he has produced, or can produce.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that there was none but God alone before the World was Created, and he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it without Knowledge and without Idea's: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently thoſe Idea's which God had of the World, are not different from himſelf; and thus all Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, even the moſt Material and moſt Terreſtrial, are in God, though in a manner altogether Spiritual, which we cannot apprehend. God therefore ſees all Beings in himſelf, in conſidering his own Perfections which repreſent them to him. He alſo knows their Exiſtence perfectly, for ſince the Exiſtence of all things depend on his Will, he cannot be Ignorant of his own Will; it follows then, that he cannot be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their Exiſtence. And thus God does not only ſee in himſelf the Eſſence of all things, but alſo their Exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>But the caſe is different as to Created Spirits, they can neither ſee the Eſſence of things, nor their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence within themſelves: They cannot ſee their Eſſence within themſelves, becauſe being very much limited, they do not contain all Beings, like God whom we may call the Univerſal Being, or plainly <hi>He that is,</hi> as he calls himſelf. Since therefore the Humane Mind may know all Beings and Infinite Beings, and yet not contain them, it is a certain Proof, that it does
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60613:183"/>not ſee their Eſſence in it ſelf. For the Mind does not only ſee ſometimes one thing, and ſometimes another ſucceſſively, it alſo actually perceives Infinity though it does not comprehend it. So that not being actually Infinite, nor capable of Infinite Modifications at the ſame time, it is abſolutely Impoſſible that it ſhould ſee within it ſelf what is not there. Therefore it does not ſee the Eſſence of things in conſidering its own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, or by modifying it ſelf diverſly.</p>
                     <p>Neither does it ſee their Exiſtence within it ſelf, becauſe the Exiſtence of Beings do not depend upon its Will; and becauſe the Idea's of thoſe Beings may be preſent to the Mind, though they do not Exiſt; for every body may have the Idea of a Mountain of Gold, though there be no Mountain of Gold in Nature: And though we rely on the report of the Senſes to judge of the Exiſtence of Objects; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Reaſon does not aſſure us, that we ſhould always believe our Senſes, ſince we find clearly that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us. When a Man's Blood, for inſtance, is very much inflam'd; or barely when he Sleeps, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beholds Fields, Combats, and the like, which nevertheleſs are not preſent, and which perhaps never were. Therefore it is certain that it is neither within it ſelf, nor by it ſelf, that the Mind ſees the Exiſtence of things, but that in this caſe it depends upon ſome other things.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have examin'd in the preceding Chapter four different Manners in which the Humane Mind may ſee External Objects, which do not appear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to us: There only remains the Fifth, which alone appears conſonant to Reaſon, and the moſt proper to ſhew the Dependence that Spirits have on God in all their Thoughts.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:60613:183"/>
                     <p>In order to apprehend it rightly, we muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what has been ſaid in the preceding Chapter, that it is abſolutely neceſſary that God ſhould have in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Idea's of all the Beings he has created, ſince otherwiſe he could not have produced them; and that thus he ſees all thoſe Beings, by conſidering the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections which he includes in himſelf, and to which all Beings are related. Moreover, it is neceſſary to know that God is very ſtrictly united to our Souls by his Preſence, ſo that we may ſay that he is the place of Spirits, as Space is the place of Bodies. Theſe two things being ſuppoſed, it is certain that the Mind may ſee what there is in God, which repreſents Created Beings, ſince that is very Spiritual, very Intelligible, and moſt preſent to the Mind. Thus the Mind may ſee in God the Works of God, ſuppoſing God be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcover to it what there is in him which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents them. Theſe are the Reaſons which ſeem to prove, that he rather Wills than Creates an Infinite Number of Idea's in every Mind.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Although we do not abſolutely deny, that God was able to produce an Infinitely infinite Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Beings, which repreſent Objects with every Mind he Creates; yet we ought not to believe that he does ſo. For it is not only conſonant to Reaſon, but it alſo appears by the Oeconomy of Nature, that God never does by very difficult means, what may be done by a plain eaſie way: God does nothing in vain and without Reaſon: That which ſhews his Wiſdom and his Power, is not to do little things by difficult Means; for that is repugnant to Reaſon, and ſhews a limited Knowledge: But on the contrary, it is to do great things by plain eaſie Means. 'Tis thus that out of Extenſion only he produces whatever we ſee that is admirable in Nature, and even that which gives Life and Motion to Animals. For thoſe who will needs have Subſtantial Forms, Faculties, and Souls in Animals, different from their Blood, and from the Organs of their Body, in order to perform their Functions, at the ſame time ſeem to argue that God wants Underſtanding, or that he cannot do thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60613:184"/>things by Extenſion only. They meaſure the Power of God, and his Soveraign Wiſdom, by the ſmallneſs of their own Capacity. Then ſince God may make Humane Minds ſee all things, by willing barely that they ſhould ſee what is in themſelves; that is, what is in him that has a relation to thoſe things, and which repreſents them, there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that he would do it otherwiſe; and that he ſhould produce, in order thereunto, as many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finities of Infinite Numbers of Idea's, as there are Created Spirits.</p>
                     <p>But we muſt obſerve, that we are not to conclude, that Spirits ſee the Eſſence of God, becauſe they can ſee all things in God in that manner: Since what they ſee is very Imperfect; but that God is very Perfect: They ſee Matter Diviſible and Figured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there is nothing in God that is Diviſible or Figured; for God is all Beings, becauſe he is Infinite and Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all; but he is no Being in particular. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs that which we ſee is but one, or ſeveral Beings in particular, and we do not apprehend that perfect Simplicity of God which includes all Beings. Beſides that it may be ſaid, that we do not ſo much ſee the Idea's of things, as the things which thoſe Idea's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent; for when we ſee a Square, for inſtance, we do not ſay that we ſee the Idea of that Square, which is united to the Mind, but only the Square which is without us.</p>
                     <p>The Second Reaſon which may induce us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that we ſee all Beings, becauſe God Wills, that that which is in him, which repreſents them, ſhould be diſcover'd to us; and not becauſe we have as many Idea's created with us as we can ſee things; for this puts all created Spirits in an abſolute Dependence upon God, and the greateſt that can be: For this being ſo, we cannot only ſee nothing, but what God is willing we ſhould ſee, but we can alſo ſee nothing, unleſs God himſelf ſhews it us.

                     <p>But the ſtrongeſt of all Reaſons, is the manner how the Mind perceives all things. It is certain, and every body knows by Experience, that when we have a mind to think on any thing in particular, we firſt caſt our Eyes on all Beings; and in the next place we apply our ſelves to the Conſideration of the Object we deſign to think on. Now it is moſt certain that we ſee it already, though confuſedly and in general: So that as we may deſire to ſee all the Beings, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times one and ſometimes another, it is certain that all Beings are preſent to our Mind; and it appears that all Beings can only be preſent to our Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is preſent to it, that is, He who includes all things in the Simplicity of his Being.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems moreover, That the Mind would not be capable of repreſenting to it ſelf univerſal Idea's of Kinds and Species, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unleſs it ſaw all Beings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in one. For every Creature being a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Being, we cannot ſay that we ſee any thing Created, when we ſee, for inſtance, a Triangle in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60613:185"/>general. In fine, I am of opinion, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to give a good Reaſon of the Manner how the Mind comes to know ſeveral abſtracted and general Truths, unleſs it be by the preſence of him that can direct the Mind in a World of different Manners.</p>
                     <p>In fine, The Beſt, the moſt Sublime, the moſt Solid, and the chief Proof of the Exiſtence of God, or that which ſuppoſes the feweſt things, is the Idea we have of Infinity, though it does not comprehend it; and that it has a very diſtinct Idea of God, which it can only have by the Union it has with him; ſince it cannot be conceiv'd that the Idea of a Being infinitely perfect, as that we have of God, ſhould be any thing that is Created.</p>
                     <p>But the Mind has not only the Idea of Infinity, it has it even before that of Finite. For we conceive the Infinite Being, from this alone that we conceive a Being, without conſidering whether it is Finite or Infinite. But in order to conceive a Finite Being, we muſt needs retrench ſomething of that general Notion of a Being, which conſequently muſt precede. Thus the Mind perceives nothing but in Infinity; and that Idea is ſo far from being form'd by the confuſed Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all the Idea's of particular Beings, as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers imagine; that on the contrary all thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Idea's are only Participations of the general Idea of Infinity: As God does not derive his Being from the Creatures, but all Creatures only ſubſiſt by him.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Proof, which perhaps will be a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration to thoſe that are uſed to abſtracted Arguments, is this, It is impoſſible that God ſhould have any other principal End of his Actions but himſelf: It is a Notion that is common to all Men that are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any Reflection; and Holy Writ does not allow us to doubt, but that God has made every thing for himſelf. Therefore it is neceſſary, that not only our Natural Love, I mean the Motion he produces in our Mind, ſhould tend towards him: But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, That the Knowledge and the Light which he beſtows upon it, ſhould make us know any thing that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60613:185"/>is in him; for whatever comes from God can only be for God. Should God Create a Spirit, and give it for an Idea, or for the immediate Object of its knowledge the Sun: In my Opinion, God would Create that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the Idea of that Spirit, for the Sun and not for him.</p>
                     <p>God cannot therefore Create a Spirit to know his Works, unleſs that Spirit ſees God in ſome meaſure, by beholding his Works. So that we may ſay, that unleſs we do ſee God in ſome meaſure, we ſhould ſee nothing: In like manner, unleſs we do Love God, I mean, unleſs God did continually Imprint in us the Love of Good in general, we ſhould Love nothing. For that Love being our Will, we can Love nothing, nor Will any thing without him; ſince we cannot Love particular Goods, without determining towards thoſe Goods, the motion of Love, which God gives us towards him. So that as we Love nothing but by the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Love we have for God, ſo we ſee nothing but by the Natural Knowledge we have of God: And all the particular Idea's we have of Creatures, are only Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Idea of the Creator, as all the Motions of the Will for the Creatures, are only determinations of the motion for the Creator.</p>
                     <p>I believe there are no Divines but what will grant, that the Impious Love God with that Natural Love I ſpeak of: And St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and ſome other Fathers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm as an undeniable thing, That the Impious behold in God the Rule of Manners, and Eternal Truths. So that the Opinion I explain ought not to trouble any Body. Thus St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks:

                     </p>
                     <p>There are many paſſages in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> like unto this. by which he proves, that we ſee God even in this Life, by the knowledge we have of Eternal Truths. Truth is uncreated, Immutable, Immenſe, Eternal, above all things. It is true by it ſelf. It derives its Perfection from nothing: It makes Creatures more perfect; and all Spirits naturally endeavour to know it. Nothing but God can have all thoſe Perfections. Therefore Truth is God. We ſee ſome of thoſe Immutable Eternal Truths. Therefore we ſee God. Theſe are St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Reaſons, ours differ a little from them; and we are unwilling to uſe the Authority of ſo great a Man unjuſtly, to ſecond our Sentiment.</p>
                     <p>We believe that Truths, even thoſe that are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; as that twice two are four, are not ſo much as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Beings: So far are we from believing that they are in God. For it is viſible, that that Truth only conſiſts in a relation of Equality, which is between twice Two and Four. Therefore we do not ſay that we ſee God in ſeeing Truths, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, but in ſeeing the Idea's of thoſe Truths: For Idea's are real, but the Equality between the Idea's, which is Truth, has no reality. When for example, Men ſay that the Cloth they meaſure contains Three Yards; the Cloth and the Yards are real: But the Equality between Three Yards and the Cloth is not a real Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; it is only a relation that is between the Three Yards and the Cloth. When we ſay that twice Two are Four. the Idea's of the Numbers are real; but the Equality there is between them is only a Relation. Thus according to our Sentiment we ſee God, when we ſee Eternal Truths; not that thoſe Eternal Truths are God, but becauſe the Idea's on which thoſe Truths depend are in God; perhaps St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> underſtood it ſo. We alſo believe, that we know in God Change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Corrubtible things, although St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> only ſpeaks of Immutable and Incorruptible things; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60613:186"/>it is not neceſſary for that to place any Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in God; ſince it ſuffices, as we have already ſaid, that God ſhould ſhew us what there is in him that has a Relation to theſe things.</p>
                     <p>But though I ſay, we ſee in God the things that are Material and Senſible, it muſt be obſerv'd, that I do not ſay we have a Senſation of them in God, but only that it is from God who Acts in us; for God Knows ſenſible things, but he does not Feel them. When we perceive any thing that is ſenſible, Senſation and pure Idea is in our Perception. Senſation is a Modification of our Soul, and it is God that Cauſes it in us: And he may Cauſe it, though he has it not, becauſe he ſees in the Idea he has of our Soul, that it is capable of it. As for the Idea which is joyn'd to Senſation, it is in God, we ſee it, becauſe it is his pleaſure to diſcover it to us: And God joins Senſation to the Idea, when Objects are preſent, to the end that we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them as they are; and that we may have ſuch Senſations and Paſſions as we ought to have in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, We believe that all Spirits ſee the Eternal Laws as well as other things in God, but with ſome difference: They know the Eternal Order and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Truths, and even the Beings which God has made according to thoſe Truths, or according to the Order by the Union which thoſe Spirits have neceſſarily with the <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God which directs them, as we have ſhewn; But 'tis by the Impreſſion they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive continually from the Will of God, which inclines them to him, and endeavours, as it were, to render their Will abſolutely like unto his; that they know Order is a Law, I mean, that they know the Eternal Laws: How we muſt love Good, and fly from Evil: That we muſt love Juſtice more than all Riches: That it is better to Obey God than to Command Men, and many other Natural Laws. For the knowledge of all thoſe Laws is not different from the knowledge of that Impreſſion, which they always feel in themſelves, though they do not always follow it by the free choice of their Will; which they know to be
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60613:187"/>Common to all Spirits, though it is not equally ſtrong in all.</p>
                     <p>It is by that Dependance, Relation, and Union of our Mind to the <hi>Word</hi> of God, and of our Will to his Love, that we are made after the Image and Likeneſs of God: And although this may be very much defac'd by Sin, yet it is neceſſary that it ſhould ſubſiſt as long as we do. But if we bear the Image of the <hi>Word</hi> humbled upon Earth; and if we follow the Motions of the Holy Ghoſt, that Primitive Image of our firſt Creation, that Union of our Mind with the <hi>Word</hi> of the Father, and to the Love of the Father and of the Son, will be re-eſtabliſhed, and render'd indelible. We ſhall be like God, if we are like the <hi>Man God.</hi> In fine, God will be all in us, and we all in God, in a far more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner than that by which it is neceſſary for us to ſubſiſt, that we ſhould be in him, and he in us.</p>
                     <p>Here are ſome reaſons which may perſwade us,
<note place="margin">See the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations.</note> that Spirits perceive all things by the immediate Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of him who Comprehends all in the Simplicity of his Being. Every one will Judge of it according to the Internal Conviction he ſhall receive of it, after having ſeriouſly conſider'd it. But 'tis thought that there will be no probability in all the other ways of explaining theſe things; and that this laſt will appear more than probable. Thus our Souls depend on God in all reſpects. For as it is he who makes them feel Grief, Pleaſure, and all other Senſations, by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Union he has Eſtabliſh'd between them and our Body, which is no other than his Decree and general Will. Thus it is he, who by the Natural Union which he has made between the Will of Man, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of the Idea's which the Immenſity of the Divine Being includes, that makes them know what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they do know; and that Natural Union is alſo nothing elſe but his general Will. So that none but he can direct us, by repreſenting all things to us; as none but he can make us Happy, by making us taſte all manner of Pleaſures.</p>
                     <p>Let us therefore keep to this Opinion, That God is the Intelligible World, or the place of Spirits, as the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60613:187"/>material World is the place of Bodies. That they receive all their Modifications from his Power: That they find all their Idea's in his Wiſdom: And that it is by his Love that they are acted in all their regular Motions; and ſince his Power and Love are nothing but himſelf, let us believe with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that he is not far from every one of us; and that it is in him we have Life, Motion, and a Being.

                     <p>IN order to Abridge and Illuſtrate the Opinion I have ſet down, concerning the manner how the Mind perceives the different Objects of its Knowledge, it is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh in it four ways of knowing.</p>
                     <p>The Firſt is, to know things by themſelves.</p>
                     <p>The Second, to know them by their Idea's; that is, in the Senſe I take it here, by ſomething that is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from them.</p>
                     <p>The Third, to know them by Conſcience, or by Internal Sentiment.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth, to know them by Conjecture.</p>
                     <p>Things are known by themſelves,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Four ways of ſeeing things.</hi>
                        </note> and without Idea's, when being very Intelligible, they are able to Penetrate the Mind, or Diſcover themſelves to it. Things are known by their Idea's, when they are not Intelligible of themſelves, either becauſe they are Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, or becauſe they cannot penetrate the Mind, or diſcover themſelves to it. We know all thoſe things by Conſcience which are not diſtinguiſh'd from us. Laſtly, we know thoſe things by Conjecture which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60613:188"/>are different from us, and from thoſe that are known of themſelves, and by Idea's, when we think that ſome things are like unto others which we know.</p>
                     <p>God only is known by himſelf:
<note place="margin">II. <hi>How we know God.</hi>
                        </note> for though there are other Spiritual Beings beſides himſelf, which ſeem to be Intelligible by their Nature, there are none at preſent but he only, which penetrate the Mind, and diſcover themſelves to it. We only ſee God with a direct and immediate Sight. Perhaps he only can direct the Mind by his own Subſtance. Laſtly, in this Life it is only by the Union we have with him that we are capable of knowing what we know, as we have ſhewn in the preceding Chapter:
<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Humanis mentibus nulla inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſita na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura praeſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</hi> Aug. l. de Vera Religione, c. 55.</note> For he is our only Maſter, that preſides in our Mind, according to St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> without the Mediation of any Creature.</p>
                     <p>We can never conceive, that any thing that is Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated ſhould be able to repreſent Infinity; that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Being, the immenſe Being, the univerſal Being can be perceiv'd by an Idea; that is, by a particular Being, by a Being different from the Univerſal and Infinite Being. But as for particular Beings, it is not difficult to conceive, that they may be repreſented by the Infinite Being which includes them, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them after a Spiritual and conſequently very intelligible manner. Therefore it is neceſſary to ſay, that we know God by himſelf, notwithſtanding the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of him in this Life is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that we know Corporeal Things by their Idea's, that is, in God; ſince God only includes the Intelligible World, in which we find the Idea's of all things.</p>
                     <p>But though all things may be ſeen in God, it does not follow that we ſee them all in him: We only ſee ſuch things in God of which we have Idea's; and there are things which are ſeen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Idea's.</p>
                     <p>All the things that are in this World,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>How we know Bedies.</hi>
                        </note> of which we have ſome Knowledge, are either Bodies or Spirits; proprieties of Bodies, or proprieties of Spirits. No body can queſtion but that we ſee Bodies with their Proprieties by their Idea's; becauſe not being Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60613:188"/>in themſelves, we can only ſee them in the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which includes them after an intelligible manner. Thus it is in God, and by their Idea's that we ſee Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with their Proprieties; and for that reaſon the knowledge we have of them is very perfect: I mean the Idea we have of Extenſion is ſufficient to make us know all the Proprieties which Extenſion is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and we can never deſire to have a more diſtinct and fuller Idea of Extenſion of Figures and Motions than that which God gives us of them.</p>
                     <p>Whereas the Idea's of the things which are in God, include all their Proprieties, whoever ſees their Idea's, may ſucceſſively have all their Proprieties: For when we ſee things as they are in God, we ſee them always after a very perfect manner; and it would be infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect, if the Mind that ſees them there were Infinite. That which is wanting in the knowledge we have of Extenſion of Figures and Motions, is not a defect of the Idea which repreſents it, but of our Mind which conſiders it.</p>
                     <p>It is not ſo with the Soul,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>How we know our Soul.</hi>
                        </note> we do not know it by its Idea: We do not ſee it in God; we only know it by Conſcience; and therefore the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we have of it is imperfect. We know no more of our Soul, than what we feel paſſes within us. Had we never felt Pain, Heat, Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we could not know whether our Soul would be capable of them, becauſe we do not know it by its Idea. But did we ſee in God the Idea which anſwers to our Soul,
<note place="margin">See the Explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> we ſhould know at the ſame time, or might know, all the properties it is capable of: As we know all the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that Extenſion is capable of; becauſe we do know Extenſion by the Idea of it.</p>
                     <p>It is true, we know by our Conſcience, or by the Internal Senſe we have of our ſelves, that our Soul is ſomething that is Great: But it may be, that which we do know of it is hardly any thing of what it is in it ſelf. If we had no more knowledge of Matter than that of Twenty or Thirty Figures it had been modified into, certainly we ſhould hardly know any thing of it, in compariſon of what we do know by
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60613:189"/>the Idea which repreſents it. It is not therefore ſufficient to have a perfect knowledge of the Soul, to know what we do know of it by the Internal Senſe alone; ſince the Conſcience we have of our ſelves, perhaps only ſhews us the leaſt part of our Being.</p>
                     <p>It may be concluded from what has been ſaid, that though we know the Exiſtence of our Soul more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly than the Exiſtence of our Body, and of thoſe that are about us, yet we have not ſo perfect a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature of the Soul, as of the Nature of Bodies; and may ſerve to reconcile the different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of thoſe that ſay nothing is better known than the Soul; and of thoſe that maintain, there is nothing of which they have leſs knowledge.</p>
                     <p>It may alſo ſerve to prove, that the Idea's which repreſent ſome External thing to us, are not Modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Soul. For if the Soul ſaw all things in conſidering its own Modifications, it would know its Eſſence or Nature more clearly than that of Bodies; and all the Senſations or Modifications it is capable of, than the Figures or Modifications which Bodies are capable of. Nevertheleſs, it does not find that it is capable of ſuch a Senſation by the ſight it has of it ſelf, but only by Experience: Whereas it knows, that Extenſion is capable of an infinite number of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, by the Idea it has of Extenſion. Moreover, there are certain Senſations, as Colours and Sounds, which moſt Men cannot diſcover, whether or no they are Modifications of the Soul; and Men know all manner of Figures by the Idea they have of Extenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be the Modification of Bodies.</p>
                     <p>What I have ſaid, alſo ſhows the Reaſon why it is Impoſſible to give a Definition that may explain the Modifications of the Soul; for ſince we neither know the Soul, nor the Modifications of it by Idea's, but only by Senſations; and that ſuch Senſations of Pleaſure, for inſtance, of Pain, of Heat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not tied to words; it is evident, that if a Man had never ſeen Colours, nor felt Heat, it would be impoſſible to make him Senſible of thoſe Senſations, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60613:189"/>Definitions we could give him in order thereunto. Now Men having only their Senſations upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Body, and their Bodies not being diſpos'd in the ſame manner in all of them, it often happens that words are Equivocal; that thoſe which are uſed to expreſs the Modifications of our Souls, ſignifie quite contrary to what we deſign; and we often make Men think on Bitterneſs, for Example, when we deſign to make them think on Sweetneſs.</p>
                     <p>Although we have not a full Knowledge of our Soul, that which we have by Conſcience ſuffices to demonſtrate the Immortality, Spirituality, Liberty and ſome other Attributes of i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, which it is neceſſary we ſhould know: And for that reaſon God does not give us the Knowledge of it by its Idea, as he gives us the Knowledge of Bodies. 'Tis true, The Knowledge we have of our Souls by our Conſcience is Imperfect, but it is not Falſe: The Knowledge, on the contrary, which we have of Bodies by Senſation or Conſcience, (if we may call the Senſation of what paſſes in our Body Conſcience) is not only Imperfect, but Falſe. Therefore it was neceſſary we ſhould have an Idea of Bodies to correct the Senſations we have of them: But we do not ſtand in need of the Idea of our Soul, ſince the Conſcience we have of it does not engage us into Error: And not to be deceiv'd in the Knowledge of it, it is ſufficient not to Confound it with the Body, which our Reaſon might induce us to do. In ſine, Had we had a clear Idea of the Soul, like unto that we have of the Body, that Idea would have made us conſider it too much, as ſeparated from it. And thus it would have leſſen'd the Union of our Soul with our Body, by hindering us from looking upon it, as being diffus'd through all our Members, which I ſhall explain no farther.

                     </p>
                     <p>Of all the Objects of our Knowledge, there only remains the Souls of other Men, and the Pure Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences; and it is evident that we only know them by Conjecture. We know them now neither in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor by their Idea's; and as they are diſtinct from us, it is impoſſible that we ſhould know them
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60613:190"/>by Conſcience: We conjecture that the Souls of other Men are of the ſame Species with ours; we think they feel what we feel in our ſelves; and even when thoſe Senſations have no relation to the Body, we are certain that we are not deceiv'd: Becauſe we ſee in God certain Idea's, and certain Immutable Laws, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we know certainly that God acts equally in all Spirits.</p>
                     <p>I know that two and two are four, that it is better to be Juſt than Rich; and I am not miſtaken in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that others know thoſe Truths as well as my ſelf. I love Good and Pleaſure, I hate Evil and Pain, I would be Happy; and I am not miſtaken in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that Men, Angels, and even Devils, have theſe Inclinations. I know moreover, that God will never Create any Spirits, but what will deſire to be Happy, or that can ever deſire to be Unhappy: But I know it with Evidence and Certainty, becauſe God tells me ſo: For who but God could give a Knowledge of the Deſigns and Will of God? But when the Body has any Share in what paſſes within me, I am for the moſt part miſtaken, in judging of others by my ſelf. I feel Heat, I ſee ſuch a Magnitude, ſuch a Colour; I reliſh ſuch a Taſte at the approach of certain Bodies: I am deceiv'd, when I judge of others by my ſelf. I am ſubject to certain Paſſions, I have a Kindneſs or Averſion for ſuch or ſuch things; and I fancy that others are like me; my Conjecture is often Falſe. Thus the Knowledge we have of other Men, is very liable to Error, when we judge of them by the Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have of our ſelves.</p>
                     <p>If there be any Beings different from God, from our ſelves, from Bodies, and from Pure Spirits, it is unknown to us: We have much ado to perſwade our ſelves that there are any ſuch: And after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd the Reaſons of certain Philoſophers who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the contrary, we have found them Falſe; which has confirm'd us in our former Opinion, that being all Men of the ſame Nature, we had all the ſame Idea's; becauſe it behoves us all to know the ſame things.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE clear, intimate, neceſſary Preſence of God, (I mean the Unlimited, Infinite, and General Being) with the Mind of Man, acts with more Force upon it, than the Preſence of all Finite Objects. It is impoſſible that it ſhould abſolutely lay aſide that general Idea of Being, becauſe it cannot ſubſiſt out of God. Perhaps ſome might urge, that it may wander from it, becauſe it may think on thoſe particular Beings; but they would be miſtaken: For when the Mind conſiders any Being in particular, it is not ſo far from removing from God, that it rather draws near, if I may ſo ſpeak, to ſome of his Perfections, in removing from all others: However it removes from them in ſuch a manner, that it never wholly loſes the ſight of them, and it is for the moſt part in a Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſeek them out, and to draw near to them. They are always preſent to the Mind, but the Mind only perceives them in an inexplicable Confuſion, becauſe of its ſmallneſs, and the greatneſs of its Idea of <hi>Being.</hi> We may chance ſometimes not to think on our ſelves; but I believe we cannot ſubſiſt one Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without thinking on Being; and even at that very time when we fancy we think on nothing, we are of neceſſity full of the wandering and general Idea of <hi>Being.</hi> But whereas thoſe things that are very uſual in us, and which do not concern us, do not excite the Mind with any force, nor oblige
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60613:191"/>it to make any Reflection upon them; this Idea of <hi>Being,</hi> ſo Great, ſo Vaſt, ſo Real, and ſo Poſitive as it is, is yet familiar to us, and touches us ſo little, that we almoſt believe we do not ſee it; that we do not reflect upon it; that we afterwards judge there is but little Reality in it; and that it is only form'd by the confus'd mixture of all particular Idea's: Though on the contrary, it is in that alone, and by that alone, that we perceive all Beings in particular.</p>
                     <p>Although that Idea, which we receive by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Union we have with the <hi>Word</hi> of God, does never deceive us in it ſelf, like thoſe which we receive from it by means of the Union we have with our Body, which repreſent things to us different from what they are: Yet I am not afraid to ſay, that we make ſo ill a uſe of the beſt things, that the indelible Preſence of that Idea is one of the principal Cauſes of all the Irregular Abſtractions of the Mind; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of that Abſtracted and Chimerical Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, which explains all Natural Effects by general Terms of Act, Power, Cauſe, Effect, Suſtantial Forms, Faculties, occult Qualities, Sympathy, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for it is certain that all thoſe Terms, and many others, never excite any Idea's in the Mind, but ſuch as are Wandering and General; that is, of thoſe Idea's which preſent themſelves to the Mind of their own accord, without Pain, or any Application on our part.</p>
                     <p>Let Men read with all Attention imaginable, all the Definitions and Explications which are given of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Forms: Let them carefully inquire wherein the Eſſence of all thoſe Entities does conſiſt, which Philoſophers fancy as they pleaſe, and in ſo great a Number, that they are oblig'd to make ſeveral Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Sub-diviſions of them; and I am confident that they will never ſtir up any other Idea's in their Mind of all thoſe things, than that of <hi>Being,</hi> and of <hi>Cauſe</hi> in General.</p>
                     <p>For this is what commonly happens to Philoſophers: They ſee ſome new Effect; they immediately ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a new Being to produce it. Fire warms; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60613:191"/>there is ſome Being in the Fire which produces that Effect that is different from the matter which compoſes the Fire: And whereas Fire is capable of ſeveral different Effects; as of ſeparating Bodies, of reducing them to Aſhes and into Earth; of drying them, hardning them, ſoftning them, dilating them, purifying them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they liberally allow Fire as many Faculties or real Qualities, as it is capable of producing different Effects.</p>
                     <p>But thoſe that reflect on the Definitions they give of thoſe Faculties, will eaſily diſcover that they are only Logical Definitions, and that they excite no other Idea's than that of <hi>Being,</hi> and of <hi>Cauſe</hi> in General, which the Mind compares with the Effect which is produced: So that Men are not the more Learned, after having ſtudied them very much; for all they get by that kind of Study, is, that they imagine they know better than others, what they notwithſtanding do not know near ſo well; not only becauſe they admit many Beings which never were, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe being prejudiced, they make themſelves incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of conceiving, how it can be poſſible that matter alone, as that of Fire, being moved againſt Bodies differently diſpoſed, ſhould produce all the different Effects which we ſee Fire does produce.</p>
                     <p>It is Notorious to all thoſe that have read a little, that moſt of the Books of Sciences, particularly thoſe that treat of Natural Philoſophy, Phyſick, Chymiſtry, and all the particular things of Nature, are full of Arguments grounded upon Elementary Qualities, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, as Attractive, Retentive, Digeſtive, Expulſive, and ſuch like; upon others they call oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult; upon Specifick Vittues, and upon ſeveral Beings which Men compoſe out of the General Idea of Being, and that of the Cauſe of the Effect which they ſee; which ſeems not poſſible to happen, unleſs by the Faculty they have of conſidering the Idea of the Being in General, which is ever preſent to their Mind, by the Infinite Preſence of him that includes all Beings.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60613:192"/>
                     <p>If common Philoſophers would content themſelves with publiſhing their Natural Philoſophy barely as a Logick, which would furniſh proper Terms to ſpeak of the things of Nature; and if they would let thoſe alone that fix diſtinct and particular Idea's to thoſe Terms in order to be underſtood, no body would find fault with their proceeding. But they even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to explain Nature by general and abſtracted Idea's, as if Nature were Abſtracted. And they will needs have it, that their Maſter <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Natural Philoſophy is a real Natural Philoſophy, which through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explains things, and not meerly a Logick; though it contains nothing that is tolerable, beſides ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Definitions, and ſome Terms that are ſo general, that they may ſerve for all ſorts of Philoſophy. Laſtly, They are ſo ſtrangely conceited with all thoſe Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Beings, and wandering undetermined Idea's, which naturally ariſe within their Mind, that they are Incapable of fixing their Mind long enough to conſider the real Idea's of things,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Of the Eſſence of Matter. If that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition is receiv'd of the word</hi> Eſſence, <hi>all the reſt is abſolutely demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: If it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a queſtion of Name, to know wherein conſiſts the Eſſence of the Matter, or rather it cannot be queſtion'd.</hi>
                        </note> ſo as to diſcover the Solidity and Evidence of them. And this is the true Cauſe of the extream Ignorance they are in, as to the true Principles of Natural Philoſophy. It is convenient to give ſome Proofs of it.</p>
                     <p>Moſt Philoſophers do partly agree, That we ought to look upon that as the Eſſence of a thing, which we acknowledge to be the firſt in that thing, that which is Inſeparable from it, and on which the Properties that agree to it do depend. So that to diſcover wherein the Eſſence of Matter does conſiſt, we muſt look upon all the Properties that are agreeable to it, or which are included in the Idea we have of it; as Hardneſs, Soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Fluidity, Motion, Reſt, Figure, Diviſibility, Impenetrability and Extenſion, in order to conſider which of all theſe Attributes is Inſeparable from it. Therefore ſince Fluidity, Hardneſs, Softneſs, Motion, Reſt, may be ſeparated from Matter, ſince there are ſeveral Bodies that are without Hardneſs, Fluidity, or Softneſs, that are not in motion; or laſtly, that are not in Reſt: It follows clearly, that all thoſe Attributes are not Eſſential to it.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60613:192"/>
                     <p>But there ſtill remains four which we do conceive to be Inſeparable from Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> Figure, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, Impenetrability and Extenſion: So that in order to ſee which is the Attribute that is to be taken for the Eſſence, we muſt no longer think of dividing them, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> only to examine which is the firſt, and which ſuppoſes no other. It is eaſily apprehended, that Figure, Diviſibility, and Impenetrability, ſuppoſes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, and that Extenſion ſuppoſes nothing; but as ſoon as it is given, Diviſibility, Impenetrability, and Figure are given. Therefore we muſt conclude, That Extenſion is the Eſſence of Matter, ſuppoſing it has only the Attributes we have mentioned, or others like them; and I do not believe that any body in the World can queſtion it, after ſerious Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p>But the Difficulty is to know, whether Matter has not ſome other Attributes different from Extenſion, and from thoſe that depend on it: So that Extenſion it ſelf is not Eſſential to it, but ſuppoſes ſomething that may be the Subject and Principle of it.</p>
                     <p>Several Perſons, after having attentively conſider'd the Idea they had of Matter by all its known Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes; and after having likewiſe meditated on the Effects of Nature, as much as the Powers and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Mind will permit, have been ſtrongly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that Extenſion ſuppoſes nothing in Matter; whether it be that they have not had a diſtinct and particular Idea of that thing which may be believed to precede Extenſion, or whether they have ſeen no Effect to prove that thing.</p>
                     <p>For, as to be perſwaded, that a Watch has no being different from the Matter whereof it is compoſed, it is ſufficient to know, how the different diſpoſition of the Wheels, can produce all the Motions of a Watch, without having any diſtinct Idea of that which might be the cauſe of thoſe Motions, though ſeveral Logical ones might be given: So becauſe thoſe Perſons have no diſtinct Idea of that thing which might be in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if Extenſion were taken from it; becauſe they ſee no Attribute to diſcover it; and becauſe, if Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60613:193"/>be given, all the Attributes which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to belong to Matter, are given; and alſo that Matter is the cauſe of no Effect, but ſuch as we may conceive Extenſion differently configur'd, and diverſly agitated may produce; from whence they perſwade themſelves that Extenſion is the Eſſence of the Matter.</p>
                     <p>But whereas Men have no certain Demonſtration, that there is no Intelligence or new Being created in the Wheels of a Watch: So no body can, without a particular Revelation, aſſert as a Geometrical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that there is nothing in a Stone beſides Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion diverſly conſigur'd: For Extenſion may abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely be joyn'd with ſomething elſe which we do not conceive, becauſe we have no Idea of it: Though it ſeems very unreaſonable to believe and affirm it; ſince it is unreaſonable to affirm what we neither know or conceive.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs though we ſhould ſuppoſe, that there is ſomething beſides Extenſion in Matter, that would not hinder (if rightly obſerv'd) Extenſion from being the Eſſence of it, according to the Deſinition we have given of that word. For it is abſolutely neceſſary that whatever is in the World, ſhould be either a Being, or the manner of a Being; an attentive Mind cannot deny it. Now Extenſion is not the manner of a Being; therefore 'tis a Being. But whereas Matter is not a Compoſition of ſeveral Beings, like Man, who is compoſed of Body and Mind; ſince Matter is but one Being only, it is evident that Matter is only Extenſion.</p>
                     <p>Now to prove that Extenſion is not the manner of a Being, but that it is really a Being, we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the manner of a Being cannot be conceiv'd, unleſs the Being, of which it is the manner, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at the ſame time: It is impoſſible, for Example, to conceive Roundneſs without conceiving Extenſion, becauſe the manner of a Being, is nothing but the Being it ſelf ſo modified: The roundneſs of Wax, for inſtance, being nothing but the Wax it ſelf ſo modified, it's evident that we cannot poſſibly conceive the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner without the Being. Therefore if Extenſion were
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60613:193"/>the manner of a Being, we could not conceive this Extenſion without that Being, of which this Extenſion ſhould be the manner. Nevertheleſs it is eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by it ſelf. Therefore it is not the manner of any Being, and conſequently it is a Being it ſelf. Thus it proves the Eſſence of Matter, ſince Matter is only one Being, and not a Compound of divers Beings as aboveſaid.</p>
                     <p>But many Philoſophers are ſo wedded to general Idea's, and Logical Entities, that their Mind is more taken up with them, than with thoſe that are Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, Diſtinct and Phyſical. This is ſufficiently appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, in that their Arguments upon Natural Things, are only grounded upon Notions of Logick, Act and Power, and of an Infinite Number of Imaginary Entities, which they do not diſtinguiſh from thoſe that are Real. Therefore thoſe Men finding a wonderful Facility of ſeeing according to their own way, what they have a mind to ſee, fancy that they ſee better than others; and that they ſee diſtinctly that Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuppoſes ſomething, and that it is only a Propriety of Matter, of which it may even be diveſted.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, when they are deſir'd to explain that thing, which they pretend to ſee in Matter beſides Extenſion, they do it in different ways, which all ſhew that they have no other Idea of it than that of Being, or of Subſtance in General. This appears clearly to thoſe that obſerve, that the ſaid Idea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no particular Attributes which are proper to Matter. For in removing Extenſion from Matter, they take away all the Attributes and all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties which we diſtinctly conceive do belong to it, although one ſhould leave that thing which they fancy to be the Eſſence of it: It is viſible that they could neither make a Heaven nor Earth of it, nor any thing that we ſee. And on the contrary, in removing what they fancy to be the Eſſence of Matter, provided Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion be left, we leave all the Attributes and all the Proprieties, which we conceive to be diſtinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Idea of Matter: For it is certain, that with Extenſion alone may be form'd a Heaven, an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60613:194"/>Earth, and all the viſible World, beſides an infinite Number of others. Therefore, that ſomething which they ſuppoſe beſides Extenſion, having no Attributes, which can be diſtinctly conceiv'd to belong to it, and which are clearly included in the Idea we have of it, is nothing real, if we believe Reaſon; and it can be of no uſe to explain Natural Effects. And what they urge, that it is the <hi>Subject,</hi> and the <hi>Principle</hi> of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion is ſpoken at random, without conceiving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly what they ſay; that is, without having any other Idea thereof, than a General or Logical one, as of <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Principle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that one might ſtill imagine a new <hi>Subject,</hi> and a new <hi>Principle</hi> of that Subject of Extenſion, and thus on <hi>ad Infinitum;</hi> becauſe the Mind repreſents to it ſelf general Idea's of <hi>Subject,</hi> and of <hi>Principles,</hi> as it pleaſes.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it's very probable, that Men would never have obſcur'd the Idea they have of Matter ſo much, unleſs they had had ſome Reaſons for it; and ſeveral maintain Sentiments contrary to ours, through Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Divinity. Without doubt Extenſion is not the Effence of Matter, if that be contrary to Faith, we grant it. We are, Thanks be to God, fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the Weakneſs and Limitation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Mind. We very well know, that it has too little Extent to meaſure an Inſinite Power; That God can do Infinitely more than we can conceive; That he only gives us Idea's to know things that happen according to the Order of Nature, but he conceals the reſt from us. Therefore we are ever ready to ſubmit our Mind to Faith; but there muſt be better Proofs than thoſe that are commonly alledg'd, to deſtroy the Reaſons aboveſaid, becauſe the manner of Explaining the Myſteries of Faith is not of Faith, and they are believ'd, even without apprehending that the manner of them can ever be clearly explain'd.</p>
                     <p>We believe, for Example, the Myſtery of the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>nity, though the Humane Mind cannot conceive it; and nevertheleſs we believe, that things which do not diſter from the ſame <hi>Third,</hi> do not di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60613:194"/>though this Propoſition ſeems to deſtroy it. For we are perſwaded that we muſt never make uſe of our Mind, unleſs on Subjects that are proportion'd to its Capacity; and we muſt not look fixedly on Myſteries, for fear of being dazled by them, according to this Advertiſement of the Holy Ghoſt: <hi>Qui ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator eſt Majeſtatis opprimetur à Gſoria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if it were thought proper, for the Satisfaction of ſome Men, to explain how far the Opinion we have of Matter, agrees with what Faith teaches us about Tranſubſtantion, we might perhaps do it clearly and diſtinctly enough, and without offending the Deciſions of the Church; but we are of Opinion, that we may very well forbear making that Explication, eſpecially in this Work.</p>
                     <p>For we muſt obſerve, that the Holy Fathers have moſtly ſpoken of that Myſtery, as of an Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Myſtery; that they have not Philoſophis'd to explain it; and that commonly they have only us'd Compariſons that have not much Exactneſs in them; fitter to diſcover the Doctrine, than to give an Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that might ſatisfie the Mind: So that Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for thoſe who do not Philoſophiſe upon that Myſtery, and who ſubmit their Mind to Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puzzling themſelves to no purpoſe in thoſe diſſicult Queſtions.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it would be unreaſonable to deſire Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers to give clear and eaſie Explanations of the manner how the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; for that would be to deſire them to tell No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties in Divinity. And ſhould Philoſophers Impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently anſwer that Queſtion, they could not avoid the Condemnation either of their Philoſophy, or of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: For if their Explanations were Obſcure, the Principles of their Philoſophy would be deſpis'd; and thould their Anſwer prove clear or eaſie, Men would reaſonably ſuſpect the Novelty of their Divinity.</p>
                     <p>Since then Novelty, in Point of Divinity, bears the Character of Error, and that Men have a Right to deſpiſe Opinions, only becauſe they are new, and have no Foundation in Tradition; we ought not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60613:195"/>to give eaſie and intelligible Explanations of things, which the Fathers and the Councils have not fully explain'd; and it is ſufficient to believe the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, without pretending to explain the manner of it. For otherwiſe we ſhould ſpread Seeds of new Diſputes and Quarrels, of which there are but too many already; and the Enemies of Truth would not fail to make a malicious uſe of it to oppreſs their Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>Diſputes in Point of Explanations of Divinity, ſeem to me to be the moſt Uſeleſs and the moſt Dangerous; and they are the more to be fear'd, by reaſon that even Pious Perſons think themſelves oblig'd to break the Bonds of Charity with thoſe that are not of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. We have but too many Inſtances of it, and the reaſon of it is plain enough. Therefore it is always the beſt and ſafeſt way, not to be over-haſty in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things of which we have no Evidence, and which others are not diſpoſed to conceive.</p>
                     <p>Neither muſt obſcure and uncertain Explanations of the Myſteries of Faith, ſerve us as a Rule and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to reaſon in Philoſophy, in which nothing but Evidence ought to perſwade us. We muſt not change the clear and diſtinct Idea's of Extenſion, Figure, and Local Motion, for theſe general and confuſe Idea's of <hi>Principles,</hi> or of the <hi>Subject</hi> of Extenſion, of Form, and of Quiddities, of real Qualities, and of all thoſe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Generation, of Corruption, of Alteration, and the like, which differ from Local Motion. Real Idea's produce a Real Science, but the general Idea's of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick will never produce any thing but a rambling, ſuperficial and barren Science. Therefore it behoves us to conſider attentively, thoſe diſtinct and particular Idea's of things, in order to diſcover the Proprieties they include; and thus to ſtudy Nature, inſtead of loſing our ſelves in Chimera's, which only exiſt in the Opinion of ſome Philoſophers.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>IV. <hi>We ought not to judge that there are only Bodies or Spirits, nor that God is a Spirit, as we conceive Spirits.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have hitherto ſpoken of Errors,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>The laſt General Cauſe of our Errors.</hi>
                        </note> for which we can aſſign ſome occaſional Cauſe in the Nature of the Pure Underſtanding, or of the Mind conſider'd, as acting of it ſelf, and in the Nature of Idea's, that is, in the manner how the Mind perceives External Objects. There now remains only to explain a Cauſe, which may be call'd a Univerſal and General Cauſe of all our Errors; becauſe we conceive no Error, but what depends in ſome meaſure on it. That Cauſe is, That Nothing having no Idea to repreſent it, the Mind is induc'd to believe, that things it has no Idea of, do not Exiſt.</p>
                     <p>It is certain, that the general Source of our Errors, as we have already often declar'd, is, becauſe our Judgments have more Extenſion than our Perceptions. For when we conſider ſome Object, we commonly behold it only on one ſide, and we are not contented with judging of ſo much as we have conſider'd, but we alſo judge of the whole Object. Therefore it often happens that we are deceiv'd, becauſe, though the thing be true on that part we have examin'd it, it commonly proves falſe on the other, and that which we believe to be true only proves likely. Moreover it is evident, that we ſhould not judge abſolutely of things as we do, if we did not think we had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd them on all ſides, or if we did not ſuppoſe them anſwerable to thoſe we have examin'd. Therefore the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60613:196"/>general Cauſe of our Errors, is, That having no Idea of the other ſides of our Object, or of their difference from that which is preſent to our Mind; we fancy that thoſe other ſides are not, or at leaſt we ſuppoſe that they have no particular difference.</p>
                     <p>This manner of proceeding ſeems pretty reaſonable to us: For Nothing forming no Idea's in the Mind, we have ſome reaſon to believe, that thoſe things which form no Idea's in the Mind, while they are examin'd, reſemble Nothing. And that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms us in this Opinion, is, That we are perſwaded, by a kind of Inſtinct, that the Idea's of things are due to our Nature, and that they are ſubmitted to the Mind in ſuch a manner, that they ought to preſent themſelves before it, as ſoon as it deſires it.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs if we did but reflect on the preſent State of our Nature,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>The Idea's of things are not preſent to the Mind as ſoon as 'tis deſir'd.</hi>
                        </note> we ſhould not be ſo ready to believe, that we have all the Idea's of things as ſoon as we deſire them. Man, as I may ſay, is only Fleſh and Blood ſince the Fall. The leaſt Impreſſion of his Senſes, and of his Paſſions, breaks the ſtrongeſt Attention of his Mind; and the Courſe of the Spirits, and of the Blood, draws it away, and drives it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually towards Senſible Objects. It often ſtrives in vain againſt the Torrent which drives it along; and 'tis but ſeldom that it makes any Oppoſition; for there is too much Delight in following it, and too much Fatigue to oppoſe it. Therefore the Mind is diſguſted and ſinks as ſoon as it makes the leaſt Effort to take hold of, and to ſix upon ſome Truth: It is abſolutely Falſe in the State in which we are, that the Idea's of things are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to our Mind whenever we have a Mind to conſider them. Therefore we ought not to judge that things are not, only becauſe we have no Idea's of them.</p>
                     <p>But though we ſhould ſuppoſe Man to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolure Maſter of his Mind and of his Idea's,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>All Et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Minds are liable to Error.</hi>
                        </note> he would nevertheleſs be ſubject to Error by his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For the Mind of Man is limited, and a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60613:196"/>Mind that is limited, is Naturally liable to Error. The reaſon of it is, the leaſt things have many Relations among themſelves, and nothing but an Infinite Mind can apprehend them. Therefore a limited Mind not being able to imbrace, or to apprehend all thoſe Relations, whatever Effort it makes, is induc'd to believe, that thoſe which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not, do not exiſt, particularly when we do not reflect on the Weakneſs and Limitation of our Mind, which is very uſual. Thus the Limitation of the Mind alone, infers a Capability of falling into Error.</p>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs, if Men, even in the State of Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Depravations in which they are, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways make a good uſe of their Liberty, they would never be deceiv'd. And therefore all Men that fall into Error, are juſtly blam'd, and deſerve to be puniſh'd: For if we would not be deceiv'd, we muſt only judge of what we ſee, and never make entire Judgments, but on ſuch things which we are ſure we have examin'd in all their parts, which we can do. But they had rather ſubmit to Error, than to the Rule of Truth: They will decide without much difficulty and Examination. Therefore we need not wonder if they fall into many Errors, and very often make uncertain Judgments.</p>
                     <p>Men, for Example,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>We ought not to judge that there are only Bodies and Spirits created, nor that God is a Spirit as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi>
                        </note> have no other Idea's of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than that of the Mind and Body; that is, Of a Subſtance that Thinks, and of a Subſtance that is Extended. And from thence they pretend to have a Right to conclude, that whatever Exiſts is Body or Spirit: Not that I pretend to affirm, that there is any Subſtance that is neither Body nor Spirit: For we ought never to affirm, that things Exiſt which we have no Knowledge of; ſince it is to be thought, that God who does not conceal his Works from us, would have given us ſome Idea's of them. Nevertheleſs I am of Opinion, that we ought not to determine any thing about the Number of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Beings which God has Created, by the Idea's
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60613:197"/>we have of them; ſince it is abſolutely poſſible that God may have Reaſons to Conceal them from us, which we do not know; if it were only becauſe thoſe Beings having no Relation to us, it would be uſeleſs for us to know them: By the ſame reaſon as he has not given us Eyes good enough to tell the Teeth of a Hand-worm, becauſe it is not very material for the preſervation of our Body, to have ſuch a piercing Sight.</p>
                     <p>But though we think no body ought to Judge raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all Beings are Spirits or Bodies; we think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, that it is directly contrary to Reaſon, that Philoſophers in order to explain Natural Effects, ſhould uſe other Idea's, than thoſe that depend on Thought and Extenſion, ſince indeed they are the only we have, that are diſtinct or particular.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can be more unreaſonable, than to imagin an Infinity of Beings upon bare Idea's of Logick; to impute an Infinity of Proprieties to them; and thus to endeavour to explain things we do not underſtand, by things which do not only conceive, but which is not poſſible for us to conceive. 'Tis juſt as if the Blind having a mind to ſpeak of Colours among themſelves, and to maintain a Theſis about them, ſhould in order thereunto, make uſe of the Definitions which Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers give them, and draw ſeveral Concluſions from the ſame. For as thoſe Blind could only give pleaſant and ridiculous Arguments upon Colours, becauſe they could have no perfect Idea's of them, and yet would argue about them upon General and Logical Idea's: So Philoſophers can never argue ſolidly upon the Effects of Nature, when to that end, they only make uſe of general Logical Idea's, of Act, Power, Being, Cauſe, Principle, Form, Quality, and the like. It is abſolutely neceſſary for them only to rely on diſtinct and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Idea's of Thought and Extenſion, and thoſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, as Figure, Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For it is in vain to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to underſtand Nature, but by the Conſideration of the diſtinct Idea's we have of it; and it is better never to meditate, than upon Chimera's.</p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60613:197"/>
                     <p>Nevertheleſs we cannot affirm that there are only Bodies and Spirits, Beings that think, and that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, becauſe we may be deceiv'd in it. For though they are ſufficient to Explain Nature, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently we may conclude without fear of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, that the Natural Things we have ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, depend on Extenſion and Thought; yet it is certainly poſſible, that there may be others of which we have no Idea, and of which we ſee no Effects.</p>
                     <p>Men therefore Judge raſhly, when they Judge as an Infallible Principle, that all Subſtances are Bodies or Spirits. But they alſo infer a raſh Concluſion from thence, when they conclude by the bare Teſtimony of Reaſon that God is a Spirit. It is true, that ſince we are Created after his Image and Likeneſs, and that Holy Writ teaches us in ſeveral Places that God is a Spirit, we ought to believe it, and to call him ſo: But Reaſon alone cannot teach it us. That tells us only that God is a Being infinitely Perfect; and that he is rather a Spirit than a Body, ſince our Soul is more perfect than our Body: But it does not aſſure us that there are no Beings beſides more perfect than our Spirits; and more above our Spirits, than our Spirits are above our Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuppoſing that there were ſuch Beings, (as it undeniably appears that it was in the power of God to Create ſuch) it is clear that they would participate more of the likeneſs of God than we do. The ſame Reaſon teaches us, that God would ſooner have the Perfections of their Beings than ours, which would only be Imperfections compar'd to them. Therefore we muſt not Judge raſhly, that the word Spirit which we uſe to expreſs what God is, and what we are, is an Equivocal Term, which ſignifies the ſame things, or things that are very like. God is more above Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Spirits, than thoſe Spirits are above Bodies; and we ought not ſo much to call God a Spirit to ſhew poſitively what he is, as to ſignifie that he is not Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. He is a Being infinitely Perfect, no body can
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60613:198"/>queſtion it. But as we muſt not imagin with the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropomorphites,</hi> that he muſt have a Human Figure, becauſe it ſeems to be moſt perfect, although we ſhould ſuppoſe him Corporeal, neither muſt we imagin that the Spirit of God has any Human Thoughts: And that his Spirit is like unto ours, becauſe we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is more perfect than our Spirit. We muſt rather believe, that as he poſſeſſes the Perfections of Matter without being Material, ſince it is certain that Matter has a relation to ſome Perfections that are in God; he alſo poſſeſſes the Perfections of Created Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, without being a Spirit in the manner as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Spirits: That his Name is, <hi>He that is;</hi> that is, the unlimited Being, the All-Being, the Infinite and Univerſal Being.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Examples of ſome Phyſical Errors, into which Men fall, becauſe they ſuppoſe that things which differ in their Nature, Qualities, Extenſion, Duration, and proportion, are alike in all things.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE have ſeen in the preceding Chapter, that Men Judge raſhly, when they Judge that all Beings are only of two ſorts, Spirits or Bodies. We will ſhew in the following, that their Judgments are not only raſh, but alſo very falſe, which are the principles of an infinite number of Errors, when they Judge that Beings are not different in their Relations nor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, becauſe they have no Idea's of thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</p>
                     <p>It is moſt certain, that the Mind of Man only looks for the relations of Things; firſt thoſe which the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects it conſiders may have with it; and in the next place, thoſe they have towards one another. For the Mind of Man only ſeeks its Good and Truth. In order to find its Good, it carefully conſiders by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and by Taſte or Senſation, whether Objects have a Relation of agreement with it. To diſcover the Truth, it conſiders whether Objects have a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Equality, or of Likeneſs one with another, or what is the exact meaſure of their Inequality. For as Good is only the good of the Mind, becauſe it is convenient for it: So Truth is only Truth by the Relation of Equality, or of Likeneſs that is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two or many things: Whether between two or many Objects, as between a Yard and Cloth; for it is true that this Cloth holds out a Yard, becauſe there is an Equality between the Yard and the Cloth: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther between Two, or many Idea's, as between the two Idea's of Three and Three, and that of Six; for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60613:199"/>it is true that three and three are Six, becauſe there is an Equality between the two Idea's of Three and Three, and that of Six: Laſtly, Whether between Idea's and Things, when the Idea's repreſent what the Things are: For when I ſay that there is a Sun, my propoſition is True; becauſe the Idea's I have of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, and of the Sun, repreſent that the Sun does really Exiſt. So that all the Action, and all the Attention of the Mind upon Objects, is only in order to endeavour to diſcover the Relations of them, ſince Men only apply themſelves to Things, that they may diſcover the Truth or Goodneſs of them.</p>
                     <p>But as we have already noted in the preceding Chapter, Attention Fatigues the Mind. It is ſoon tir'd with reſiſting the Impreſſion of the Senſes which removes it from its Object, and leads it to others, which the Love it has to its Body renders agreeable to it. It is extreamly limited; and thus the differences which are between the Subjects which it Examins, being Infinite, or almoſt Infinite, it is not capable to diſtinguiſh them. The Mind therefore ſuppoſes Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Reſemblances, in which it obſerves no poſitive and real differences: The Idea's of Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more preſent to it, more familiar, and plainer than others. For it is plain, that Reſemblance includes but one Relation; and that one Idea is ſufficient to Judge that a Thouſand Things are alike: Whereas in order to Judge without fear of being deceiv'd, that a Thouſand Objects are different among themſelves, it is abſolutely neceſſary to have a Thouſand different Idea's preſent to the Mind.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Men imagin that things of a different Nature are of the ſame Nature; and that all things of the ſame Species ſcarce differ from one another. They Judge that unequal things are Equal; that thoſe that are Inconſtant are Conſtant; and that thoſe that are without Order and Proportion, are well order'd and proportion'd. In a word, they often think that Things that are different in Nature, Quality, Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60613:199"/>Duration, and Proportion, are alike in all thoſe things. But that deſerves to be explain'd more at large by ſome Examples, becauſe it occaſions many Errors.</p>
                     <p>The Mind and Body, the Subſtance which Thinks, and that which is Extended, are two kinds of Being altogether different, and directly oppoſite: What is proper for the one, is improper for the other. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, moſt Men reflecting but little on the Idea they have of Thought, and being continually affected with Bodies, look upon the Soul and Body as one and the ſame thing: Imagining a Reſemblance between two things that are different. They fancy the Soul to be Material, that is, Extended throughout the whole Body, and Figur'd like the Body. They impute that to the Mind, which only ſuits with the Body.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, Men being ſenſible of Pleaſure, Pain, Odours, Taſtes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Body being more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them than their Soul: That is, eaſily imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Body, and not being able to imagin their Soul, they attribute to it the faculties of Feeling, Imagining, and even ſometimes of Conceiving; which can only belong to the Soul. But the following Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will be more ſenſible.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that all Natural Bodies, even thoſe that are call'd Species, differ one from another; that Gold is not abſolutely like Gold; and that one drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is different from another. It is with all Bodies of the ſame Species, as it is with Faces. All Faces have Eyes, a Noſe, a Mouth, they are all Faces, and Mens Faces; and yet there never were two perfectly alike. So a piece of Gold has parts like unto another piece of Gold; and a drop of Water has undoubtedly a great Reſemblance with another drop of Water: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs one may affirm, that it is impoſſible to give two drops of it, though taken out of the ſame River, perfectly alike. And that Philoſophers inconſiderably ſuppoſe Eſſential Reſemblances between Bodies of the ſame Species, or Reſemblances which conſiſt in Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibility;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60613:200"/>for the Eſſences of Things conſiſt in an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible,</hi> according to their Falſe Opinions.</p>
                     <p>The Reaſon of their falling into ſo groſs an Error, is, becauſe they will not conſider thoſe things carefully, upon which they nevertheleſs compoſe large Volumes. For as Men do not allow a perfect Reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Faces, becauſe they obſerve them nearly; and the habit of diſtinguiſhing them, makes us obſerve the leaſt differences in them: So, if Philoſophers would conſider Nature with ſome Attention, they would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a ſufficient number of Cauſes of Diverſity in thoſe very things, which produce the ſame Senſations in us, and which for that reaſon we ſay, are of the ſame Species; nor would they ſo eaſily ſuppoſe Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Reſemblances. Blind Men would be to blame, in ſuppoſing an Eſſential Reſemblance between Faces which ſhould conſiſt in Indiviſibility, becauſe they do not ſenſibly perceive the differences of them: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Philoſophers ought not to ſuppoſe ſuch Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances in Bodies of the ſame Species, becauſe they obſerve no difference in them, by the Senſations they have of them.</p>
                     <p>The Inclination we have to ſuppoſe a Reſemblance in Things, inclines us alſo to believe, that there is a determin'd number of Differences and Forms; and that thoſe Forms are neither capable of more or leſs. We Fancy that all Bodies differ one from another, as it were by degrees: That thoſe very Degrees obſerve certain Proportions among them: In a word, we Judge of Material Things as of Numbers.</p>
                     <p>It is clear, the Reaſon of all this is, that the Mind loſes it ſelf in the Relations of Incommenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things, ſuch as Infinite Differences are, which are not within Natural Bodies, and that it pleaſes it ſelf when it imagins ſome Reſemblance, or ſome Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them; becauſe then it repreſents ſeveral things to it ſelf with a great deal of Eaſe. For as I haue already ſaid, one Idea is ſufficient to Judge that ſeveral things are alike, and there muſt be ſeveral to Judge that they are different from one another. For
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60613:200"/>inſtance, if the Number of Angels be known, and there are Ten Arch-Angels for every Angel; and Ten Thrones for every Arch-Angel; and thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, keeping the ſame proportion from One to Ten, unto the laſt Order of Intelligences; the Mind may eaſily know the Number of thoſe Bleſſed Spirits; nay, even Judge of them partly at one Proſpect by a ſtrong Attention, which delights it infinitely. And perhaps it is that which has induc'd ſome Perſons to Judge thus of the Numbers of Celeſtial Spirits: Which is the Caſe of ſome Philoſophers, who have put a Decuple proportion of Weight and of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among the Elements, ſuppoſing Fire to be Ten times Lighter than Air, and ſo of the reſt.</p>
                     <p>When the Mind finds its ſelf oblig'd to admit dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between Bodies by the different Senſations it has of them, as alſo by ſome other particular Reaſons, it always puts the leaſt it can. For that reaſon it is eaſily perſwaded that the Eſſences of Things conſiſt in an Indiviſibile, and that they are like Numbers, as we ſaid before; becauſe one Idea is ſufficient to Repreſent to us all the Bodies which are call'd of the ſame Species. For example, if you put a Glaſs of Water in an Hogſhead of Wine, Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers will have it, that the Eſſence of the Wine ſtill remains the ſame; and that the Water is converted into Wine. That as between Three and Four there can be no Number, ſince true Unity is Indiviſible, ſo it is neceſſary that the Water be Converted into the Nature and Eſſence of the Wine, or that the Wine loſe its Nature; That as all Quaternary Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are perfectly alike, ſo the Eſſence of the Water is perfectly alike in all Waters. That as the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Three differs Eſſentially from the Number of Two, and that it cannot have the ſame Proprieties as that has, ſo two Bodies of different Species differ Eſſentially, and in ſuch a manner, that they have never the ſame Proprieties which proceed from Entity, and other like things. Nevertheleſs, if Men would conſider the true Idea's of things with ſome
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60613:201"/>Attention, they would ſoon diſcover, that all Bodies being Extended, their Nature or Eſſence has nothing reſembling Numbers; and that it cannot conſiſt in an Indiviſible.</p>
                     <p>Men do not only ſuppoſe Identity, Reſemblance, or Proportion in the Nature, Number, and Eſſential Differences of Subſtances, they alſo ſuppoſe them in all things they ſee. Moſt Men Judge, that all the fix'd Stars are faſtened to the Heavens, as to a Roof at an Equal Diſtance from the Earth. Aſtronomers did pretend for a long while, that the Planets mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in perfect Circles; and they have invented a great number of them, as <hi>Concentriques, Excentriques, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cycles, &amp;c.</hi> to Explain the Phoenomena which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted their Opinions.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that in theſe later Ages, the moſt Learned have Corrected the Errors of the Ancients, and believe that the Planets deſcribe Ellipſes by their Motion. But if they pretend that the Ellipſes are Regular, as People are inclin'd to believe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Mind ſuppoſes Regularity, where it ſees no Irregularity; they fall into an Error which is more difficult to be Corrected, becauſe the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that can be made on the Courſe of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, cannot be ſo Exact, and ſo Juſt, as to ſhew the Irregularity of their Motions. Nothing but Natural Philoſophy can Correct that Error; for it is infinitely leſs remarkable, than that which we find in the Syſtem of perfect Circles.</p>
                     <p>But ſomething particular has happened about the Diſtance and Motion of the Planets.

                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is this the only Author that is of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: For Obſervations have made him ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſenſible of the Extravagancies of that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Harmony, which has nevertheleſs been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd by ſeveral Ancient and Modern Authors, whoſe Opinions Father <hi>Riccioli</hi> Relates and Refutes. Moreover, ſome affirm <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, to have believ'd that the Heavens, by their Regular Motions, made a moſt Wonderful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert; which Men do not hear, becauſe they are uſed to it; juſt like thoſe that Inhabit near the Fall of the Waters of <hi>Nile,</hi> do not hear the Noiſe of it. But I only relate that particular Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Harmonical Proportion of the Diſtances and Motions of the Planets, to ſhew that the Mind is delighted with Proportions, and that it often Fancies them where they are not.</p>
                     <p>The Mind alſo ſuppoſes Uniformity in the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things, and imagins they are not liable to Change and Inſtability, when it is not in ſome meaſure forced by the Relation of the Senſes, to Judge otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>All Material Things being Extended are capable of Diviſion, and conſequently of Corruption: Thoſe who reflect on the Nature of Bodies, diſcover Viſibly that they are Corruptible. Yet there has been a great number of Philoſophers who fancied that the Heavens though Material, were Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
                     <p>The Heavens are at too great a Diſtance from us, to diſcover the Revolutions that happen there; and 'tis very rare that any happen there ſo great, as to be diſcovered here. That alone has been ſufficient to perſwade many that they were really Incorruptible. And which has the more Confirm'd
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60613:202"/>their Opinion, is, that they attribute to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Qualities, the Corruption to which Sublunary Bodies are ſubject. For as they have never been in the Heavens to ſee what paſſes there, ſo they have had no Experience that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of Qualities is there; which has indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced them to believe that there is really no ſuch thing there. Therefore they have concluded that the Heavens were free from Corruption; becauſe that which Corrupts all Bodies here below, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Opinion, is not above.</p>
                     <p>It is Viſible that this Argument has no Solidity; for I cannot ſee, why there ſhould be no other Cauſe of Corruption, than thoſe Contrarieties of Qualities which they imagin; nor upon what Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation they can affirm, That there is neither Heat, nor Cold, nor Drought, nor Moiſture in the Heavens; That the Sun is not Hot, and that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> is not Cold.</p>
                     <p>There is ſome appearance of Reaſon to ſay, that very hard Stones, Glaſs, and other Bodies of that Nature do not Corrupt, ſince we ſee they ſubſiſt long in the ſame State; and though we are near enough to ſee the Alterations that ſhould happen to them. But being at ſo great a diſtance as we are from the Heavens, it is directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Reaſon to conclude, that they do not Corrupt, becauſe we feel no contrary Qualities in them, nor ſee that they Corrupt. Nevertheleſs, ſome not only ſay that they Corrupt not, but they affirm abſolutely, that they are Unalterable and Incorruptible. And the Peripateticks want but little of ſaying, that the Celeſtial Bodies are ſo many Divinities; as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> their Maſter did believe of them.</p>
                     <p>The Beauty of the Univerſe does not conſiſt in the Incorruptibility of its Parts, but in the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety that is found in them: And this great Work of the World would not be ſo admirable without that Viciſſitude of things which we obſerve in it.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60613:202"/>Matter infinitely Extended, without Motion, and conſequently without Form and Corruption, would indeed diſcover the Infinite Power of its Author; but it would give no Idea of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This is the reaſon that all Corporeal Things are Corruptible; and that there is no Body, but what receives ſome Change, which Alters and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts it in Time. God Forms even in the Boſom of Stones and Glaſs, Animals more perfect and admirable than all the Works of Men. Thoſe Bodies though very hard and dry, are Corrupted in time: The Air and Sun to which they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, alter ſome of their Parts; and ſome Worms Feed upon them, as Experience has ſhew'd.</p>
                     <p>There is no other difference between thoſe Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are very hard and dry, and others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be that they are compos'd of very groſs and ſolid Parts; and conſequently leſs capable of being agitated and ſeparated one from another, by the Motion of thoſe that hit againſt them; for which reaſon they are looked upon as Incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: Nevertheleſs, they are not ſo by their Nature, as Time, Experience, and Reaſon ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhew us.</p>
                     <p>But as for the Heavens, they are Compos'd of the moſt Fluid and ſubtle Matter, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Sun: And he is ſo far from being void of Heat and Incorruptible, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s followers ſay, that on the contrary, he is the hotteſt of all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the moſt liable to Change. It is he that Heats, Moves, and Changes all things: For it is he who produces by his Action, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his Heat, or the Motion of his Parts, all the Novelties we ſee in the Change of Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Reaſon demonſtrates theſe things: But though ſome may contradict Reaſon, yet no Body can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Experience. For ſince ſome have diſcovered in the Sun by means of Teleſcopes, Spots as large as the whole Earth, which have been form'd in it, and have been diſſipated in a little time: It
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60613:203"/>is no longer to be deny'd, but that he is more ſubject to Change than the Earth we inhabit.</p>
                     <p>All Bodies are therefore in a continual Motion and Change, and particularly thoſe that are the moſt Fluid, as Fire, Air and Water; next the parts of Living Bodies, as Fleſh, and even the Bones, and laſtly, thoſe that are the moſt ſolid: The Mind ought not to ſuppoſe a kind of Immutability in things, becauſe it ſees no Corruption or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in them; for it is not a proof that a thing is always like unto it ſelf, becauſe no difference is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in it; or that things are not, becauſe we have no Idea or Knowledge of them.</p>

                        </p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Faculty of the Mind imagining and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Reſemblances where-ever it perceives no Viſible Differences, alſo engages moſt Men into Errors, which are yet more dangerous in Points of Morality. Here are ſome Examples of them.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>French</hi> Man meets an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, or an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian:</hi> That Stranger has peculiar Humours: He has a Niceneſs of Mind; or if you pleaſe, he is Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Troubleſome. This will at firſt induce this <hi>French-man</hi> to Judge, that all <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> or <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,</hi> have the ſame Character of Mind with the Perſon they have convers'd with. He will Praiſe, or Blame them all in General: And if he meets with any other, he will fancy at firſt that he is like unto him he has already ſeen; and therefore will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be inclin'd to ſome Affection or ſecret Averſion towards him. In a word, he will Judge of all the Individuals of thoſe Nations by this famous proof, that he has ſeen one or many that had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Qualifications of Mind: Becauſe he knew not whether the reſt were different, ſuppoſing them all alike.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Religious</hi> of ſome Order commits a fault: This is a ſufficient Reaſon for thoſe who know it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn all the Individuals of that Order indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. They all wear the ſame Habit, and have the ſame Name, they are alike in that: This is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for the Common Sort of Men to Fancy that they are all alike. They ſuppoſe that they are all alike, becauſe not being able to ſearch into their Hearts, they cannot ſee poſitively whether they differ.</p>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60613:204"/>
                     <p>Calumuiators, who ſtudy how to Blaſt the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Enemies, commonly make uſe of this, and Experience teaches us that it ſucceeds for the moſt part. And indeed it is very ſuitable to the Capacity of the Common Sort of Mankind. For it is not difficult to find in numerous Communities, though never ſo Holy, ſome irregular Perſons, or ſuch as have Ill Sentiments; ſince in the Company of the Apoſtles, of which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf was the Head, there was a Thief, a Traitor, an Hypocrite; in a word, a <hi>Judas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Jews without doubt, would have been very much to blame, to paſs an Ill Judgment againſt the moſt Holy Society that ever was, becauſe of the Avarice and Fault of <hi>Judas;</hi> and if they had Condemned them all in their Hearts, becauſe they ſuffered that Ill Man among them; and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf did not puniſh him, though he was ſenſible of his Crimes.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is a manifeſt Fault againſt Reaſon, and Breach of Charity to pretend, That a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is in ſome Error, becauſe ſome of their Members were ſo, although the Heads ſhould diſſemble it, or were the promoters of it themſelves. It is true, that when all the Members will defend an Error, or Fault of their Brother, the whole Community may be thought Guilty; but that ſeldom or never happens; for it ſeems morally impoſſible that all the Members of an Order ſhould have the ſame Sentiments.</p>
                     <p>Men therefore ſhould never conclude thus from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars to Generals; but they cannot Judge ſimply of what they ſee, they always fly out into Exceſs. A Religious of ſuch an Order is a Great Man, an Honeſt Man; they conclude that all the Order is compoſed of Great Men, of Good Men. Likewiſe a Religious of an Order has Ill Sentiments: Therefore all that Order is Corrupted, and has Ill Sentiments. But theſe laſt Judgments are far more dangerous than the firſt; becauſe it is a Duty to Judge well of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the Malignity of Man occaſions that Ill
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60613:204"/>Judgments, and Diſcourſes held againſt the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others, make a ſtronger Impreſſion upon the Mind than advantageous Judgments and Diſcourſes do.</p>
                     <p>When a Worldly Man, who iudulges his Paſſions, fixes ſtrongly upon his Opinion, and pretends in the heighth of his Inclination, that he is in the right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge it, Men Judge reaſonably that he is obſtinate, and he owns it himſelf as ſoon as his Paſſion is over. So when a Pious Perſon, who is perſwaded of what he ſays, and who has diſcover'd the Truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Vanity of Worldly Things, endeavours according to that Knowledge to reform the Vices of others, and reprehends them with ſome Zeal, Men of the World alſo take him to be an obſtinate Man; and therefore they conclude that Devout Men are obſtinate. They Judge moreover, that Good Men are far more obſtinate than Vain, Ill Men; becauſe the latter only defending their Ill Opinions according to the different Motions of the Blood, and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they cannot continue long in their Sentiments: They come to themſelves again. Whereas perſons of Piety remain ſteddy; becauſe their Foundation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, and does not depend on a thing ſo inconſtant as the Circulation of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ordinary Men conclude, that Pious Men are obſtinate as well as the Vicious: Becauſe they are as Paſſionate for Truth and Virtue, as Ill Men are for Vice and Falſhood. Both ſpeak almoſt in the ſame manner, to maintain their Sentiments; they are alike in that, though they differ in the main. This is ſufficient for thoſe who do not weigh the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Reaſons, to Judge that they are alike in all things, becauſe they are alike in that manner, which every Body is capable to Judge of.</p>
                     <p>Devout Perſons are not then obſtinate, they are only ſteddy, as they ought to be; But the Vicious and Libertines are always obſtinate, though they ſhould not perſiſt one Hour in their Sentiments: Becauſe Men are only obſtinate when they defend a Falſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:60613:205"/>Opinion, although they ſhould only defend it a little while.</p>
                     <p>This is the Caſe of ſome Philoſophers, who have maintain'd Chimerical Opinions, which they lay aſide at laſt. They would have thoſe who defend conſtant Truths, whoſe certainty they ſee evidently, to part with them as bare Opinions, as they have done with thoſe they had fooliſhly been prejudic'd with. And becauſe it is difficult to have a deference for them in prejudice of Truth; as alſo becauſe the Love we have Naturally for it, inclines us to defend it earneſtly, they Judge us to be obſtinate.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Men are to blame to defend their Chimera's obſtinately; but the others are in the right to defend Truth with Vigour and Steddineſs of Mind. The manner of both is the ſame, but their Sentiments are different; and it is that difference of Sentiment, which makes the one conſtant, and the others obſtinate.</p>

               <head>THE CONCLUSION OF THE Three Firſt Books.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of this Book I have diſtinguiſhed two Parts in the Simple and Indiviſible Being of the Soul, one purely Paſſive, and the other both Paſſive and Active. The firſt is the Mind or Underſtanding, the ſecond is the Will. I have attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted three Faculties to the Mind, becauſe it receives its Modifications and Idea's from the Author of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after three different ways.</p>
               <p>I have called it Senſe, When it receives from God its Idea's that are confounded with Senſations, <hi>viz.</hi> Senſible Idea's occaſion'd by certain Motions which paſs in the Organs of its Senſes at the Preſence of Objects.</p>
               <p>I have called it Imagination and Memory, When it receives from God Idea's that are confounded with Images, which are a kind of Weak and Languiſhing Senſations that the Mind receives only through ſome Traces that are produc'd, or are ſtirr'd up in the Brain by the Courſe of the Spirits.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I have called it Pure Mind or Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it receives from God pure Idea's of Truth, without any mixture of Senſations and Images
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60613:206"/>with it. Not by the Union it hath with the Body, but through that it hath with the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God; not becauſe it is in the Material and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible World, but becauſe it ſubſiſts in the Immaterial and Intelligible one: Not to know Mutable things fit for the Preſervation of the Life of the Body, but to diſcover unchangeable Truths which preſerve the Life of the Mind.</p>
               <p>I have ſhown in the firſt and ſecond Book, that our Senſes and Imaginations are very uſeful to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to us the Relation betwixt External Bodies and our own; that all the Idea's which the Mind receives through the Body, are for the uſe of the Body; that it is impoſſible clearly to diſcover any Truth whatſoever by the Idea's of our Senſes and Imaginations; that thoſe confus'd Idea's ſerve only to engage us to our Body, and through our Body to all Senſible things: And laſtly, That if we would avoid Error, we ought not to truſt to them. I alſo concluded it Morally Impoſſible, to know by the pure Idea's of the Mind, the Relations that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt External Bodies and ours: That we muſt not argue according to theſe Idea's, to know if an Apple or a Pear are good to eat, but we muſt judge it by our Taſte. And although we may make uſe of our Minds, to diſcover after ſome confuſed manner, the Relations that are betwixt External Bodies and our own; yet it is always the ſureſt way to make uſe of our Senſes. I will give another Example, for we cannot impreſs too much on the Mind, things that are ſo Eſſential and Neceſſary.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing I would examine which is moſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous, to be Religious or Rich; if I open the Eyes of my Body, Juſtice appears a Chimera, I ſee no Attractives in it; I ſee the Juſt are Miſerable, Abandoned, Perſecuted, Defenceleſs, and without Conſolation; for he that Comforts and Upholds them, does not appear to my Eyes; and indeed I do not ſee of what uſe Juſtice or Virtue can be; but if I turn my Eyes upon Riches, I ſoon perceive their
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60613:206"/>Luſtre, and am dazled with it: Power, Grandeur, Pleaſures, and all Senſible Goods, accompany Riches; I cannot doubt but Riches are neceſſary to make one Happy. So likewiſe if I make uſe of my Ears, I hear that all Men eſteem Riches; they ſpeak of nothing but the ways of getting them; and they always Praiſe and Honour thoſe that poſſeſs them. Theſe two Senſes, and all the reſt tell me, That to be Happy I muſt be Rich: And if I ſhut my Eyes and Ears, and ask my Imagination, it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually repreſents to me what my Eyes have ſeen, and my Ears heard, as to the Advantage of Riches; but yet it will repreſent theſe things to me quite after another manner than my Senſes did, for the Imagination always enlarges the Idea's of thoſe things that have any relation to the Body, or which we Love. If I will but permit it, my Imagination will ſoon conduct me to an inchanted Palace, like thoſe of which Poets and Romances have made ſuch Magnificent Deſcriptions of; and there I ſhall ſee ſuch Beauties, which would be uſeleſs for me to deſcribe: This would convince me, that the God of Riches, who inhabits it, is only capable of making me Happy: This is what my Body is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade me to, for it ſpeaks only for it ſelf, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for its Good, that the Imagination ſhould ſtoop before the Grandeur and Splendor of Riches: But if I conſider that the Body is infinitely below the Mind, that it cannot be Maſter of it, that it cannot inſtruct it in the Truth, nor produce Light in it; and that recollecting my ſelf, I ask my ſelf; or rather (ſince I am neither my own Maſter, nor Light) if I draw near to God, and, in the Silence of my Senſes and Paſſions, ask him whether I ought to prefer Riches to Virtue, or Virtue to Riches, I ſhall hear a clear and diſtinct Anſwer of what I ought to do; an Eternal Anſwer which has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been given, is now given, and will always be given; an Anſwer which it is not neceſſary I ſhould explain, becauſe all the World knows it;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60613:207"/>either thoſe who read this Book, or thoſe who read it not; which is neither <hi>Greek, Latin, French,</hi> or <hi>German,</hi> and which is conceived by all Nations. Laſtly, An Anſwer which Comforts the Juſt in their Poverty, and which diſturbs Sinners in the midſt of their Riches: I ſhall hear this Anſwer and be convinced of it: I ſhall laugh at the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of my Imagination, and the Illuſion of my Senſes. The Inward Man, which is in me, will deride the Animal and Earthly one which I carry about me. Laſtly, The New Man ſhall increaſe, and the Old Man ſhall be deſtroy'd, provided I always obey the Voice of him who ſpeaks ſo clearly to me in the moſt Secret Receſſes of my Reaſon; and who having made himſelf Senſible to condeſcend to my Weakneſs and Infirmity, and to give me Life by thoſe very means by which he gave me Death, ſpeaks yet to me through my Senſes, after a very ſtrong, lively and familiar manner, I mean, by the preaching of his Goſpel. And if I interrogate him in all the Metaphyſical, Natural and pure Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Queſtions, as well as thoſe which regard the Regulation of Manners, I ſhall always have a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Maſter which will never deceive me. I ſhall not only be a Chriſtian but a Philoſopher: I ſhall make a good Judgment of things; and in a word, I ſhall follow both by Grace and Nature, the way which will guide me to all the Perfection I am capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of.</p>
               <p>It muſt then be concluded, from what I have ſaid, That to make the beſt uſe that we can of the Faculties of our Soul, our Senſes, Imagination, and Mind, we muſt only apply them to thoſe things for which they have been given us. We ought carefully to diſtinguiſh our Senſations and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from our pure Idea's; and judge according to our Senſations and Imaginations, of the relation that External Bodies have to ours, without making uſe of them to diſcover Truths, which they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways confound: And we muſt make uſe of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60613:207"/>pure Idea's of the Mind to diſcover Truths, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever attempting to judge by them of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that External Bodies have to ours; becauſe theſe Idea's never have Extenſion enough to repreſent them perfectly to us.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible that Men ſhould have a ſufficient Knowledge of all the Figures and Motions of the little Particles of their Body and Blood, and of thoſe of a certain Fruit in a certain time of their Sickneſs, to be able to diſcover the relation of Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt this Fruit and their Body, and that if they ſhould eat of it, it would recover them. Thus our Senſes alone are more uſeful to the Preſervation of our Health, than the Rules of Experimental Phyſick, and Experimental Phyſick than the Theoretick. But Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Phyſick, which allows much to Experience, and ſtill more to the Senſes, is the beſt, becauſe all theſe things ought to be joyn'd together.</p>
               <p>We may then uſe our Reaſon in all things, and 'tis the Privilege which it has above the Senſes and Imagination, which are limited to Senſible Things; but we ought to uſe it with Circumſpection; for though it is the chief part of our ſelves, it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that we are deceiv'd when we permit it to go too far; becauſe it cannot act ſufficiently without wearying it ſelf; I mean it cannot know ſufficiently how to make a good Judgment, and yet it will not forbear Judging.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT would not be neceſſary to Treat of Natural Inclinations, as we are going to do in this Fourth Book; nor of the Paſſions, as we ſhall do in the following; in order to diſcover the Cauſes of the Errors of Mankind, if the Underſtanding did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the Will in the Perception of Objects: But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60613:209"/>whereas it is the Will that directs it, which makes it reſolve, and applies it to ſome Objects rather than others; it is abſolutely neceſſary to apprehend its Inclinations well, to penetrate into the Cauſes of the Errors to which we are liable.</p>
                  <p>If God,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>It's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the Mind have Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as well as the Body Notions.</hi>
                     </note> when he Created this World, had produced Matter infinitely extended, without giving it any Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there would have been no difference in Bodies. All this viſible World would ſtill have been a meer Maſs of Matter, or of Extenſion, which indeed might ſerve to diſcover the Grandeur and Power of its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; but there would not be that Succeſſion of Forms, and that Variety of Bodies, which compoſe all the Beauty of the Univerſe, and which incline Mens Minds to admire the Infinite Wiſdom of the Governour thereof.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I am of Opinion, That the Inclinations of the Mind are in the Spiritual World, what Motion is in the Material World; and that if the Mind were without Inclinations, or if it never had any Deſire, we ſhould not meet with that Variety in the Order of Spiritual Things; which not only makes the World admire the Profoundneſs of the Wiſdom of God, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the Variety of Material Objects; but alſo his Mercy, his Juſtice, his Goodneſs, and generally all his other Attributes. Thus then the Difference of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations produces in the Mind, an Effect much like unto that which the Difference of Motions produces in the Body; and the Inclinations of Mens Minds, and the Motions of Bodies together, conſtitute all the Beauty of Created Beings. Thus all Spirits muſt have ſome Inclinations, as well as Bodies have diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Motions. But let us endeavour to diſcover what Inclinations they ought to have.</p>
                  <p>Were not our Nature Corrupted, it would not be neceſſary to ſeek out by Reaſon, as we are going to do, what the Natural Inclinations of Created Spirits ought to be: It would be ſufficient, in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, to conſult our ſelves, and we ſhould diſcover, by the Inward Sentiments we have of what paſſes within us, all the Inclinations we ought Naturally to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60613:209"/>have. But, whereas we know by Faith, that Sin has deſtroy'd the Order of Nature, and that Reaſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that our Inclinations are Irregular, as it will appear in the Sequel, we are obliged to go another way to work: Since we cannot truſt to what we feel, we are obliged to explain things in a more Sublime Manner; but which, without doubt, will ſeem to have but little Solidity in it, to thoſe who only eſteem what relates to the Senſes.</p>
                  <p>It is an undeniable Truth,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>The Principal End of the Actions of God is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and he only acts Mens Minds for himſelf.</hi>
                     </note> that God can have no other Principal End for his Operations but himſelf; and that he may have ſeveral Ends leſs Principal, which tend all towards the Preſervation of the Beings which he has created. He can have no Principal End but himſelf, becauſe he cannot Err; nor place his Final End in Beings which are not Perfect. But he may propoſe as a leſs Principal End the Preſervation of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Beings; becauſe as they all participate of his Goodneſs, they are neceſſarily Good, and even very Good according to Scripture, <hi>Valde bona.</hi> Therefore God Loves them, and moreover it is his Love which preſerves them; for all Beings only ſubſiſt becauſe God Loves them. <hi>Diligis omnia quae ſunt,</hi> ſays the Wiſe Man, <hi>Nihil odiſli eorum quae feciſti: Nec enim odiens aliquid conſtituiſti &amp; feciſti. Quomodo autem poſſet aliquid permanere, niſi tu voluiſſes, aut quod à to vocatum non eſſet conſerveretur.</hi> In effect it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conceive, that things which do not pleaſe a Being which is infinitely Perfect and Powerful, ſhould ſubſiſt, ſince all things only ſubſiſt by his Will. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God wills his Glory as his principal End, and the Preſervation of his Creatures for his Glory.</p>
                  <p>The Natural Inclinations of Humane Minds, being certainly continual Impreſſions of the Will of him that has created them, and does preſerve them: It is, in my Opinion, neceſſary that thoſe Inclinations ſhould be intirely like unto thoſe of their Creator and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. Therefore Naturally they can have no prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal End but his Glory; nor no other Second End but their own Preſervation and that of others; but always in relation to him from whom they have their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60613:210"/>Being. For it ſeems undeniable to me, that ſince God cannot deſire that the Will he has created ſhould Love an Inferior Good more than a Greater, that is, That it ſhould Love that which is leſs Lovely, more than that which is more Lovely: He can create nothing without inclining it towards himſelf, or command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to Love him above all things; though he may create it Free, and with a Power to withdraw and to ſtray from him.</p>
                  <p>Whereas there is properly but one Love in God,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Human Minds are meerly prone to particular Good, through the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency they have to Good in General.</hi>
                     </note> which is the Love of himſelf: And that God can Love nothing but by that Love, ſince he can Love nothing but in relation to himſelf: So God likewiſe Imprints but one Love in us, which is the Love of Good in General; and we can Love nothing but by that Love, ſince we can Love nothing but what is, or ſeems to be Good. It is the Love of Good in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which is the Principle of our particular Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſince that Love really is nothing but our Will; For as I have ſaid already in another place, The Will is nothing but the continual Impreſſion of the Author of Nature, which inclines the Mind of Man towards Good in General. Certainly we muſt not imagine that this Power we have of Loving proceeds from us, or is at our Diſpoſition. Nothing but the Power of not Loving well, or rather of miſplacing our Affections, is at our own Diſpoſition; by reaſon that being Free, we may apply, and actually do apply to particular Objects, and conſequently to falſe Objects, the Good Love which God does not ceaſe to imprint in us, while he does not ceaſe to preſerve us.</p>
                  <p>But not only our Will, or our Love for Good in General, proceeds from God; but Inclinations for particular <hi>Goods</hi> which are common to all Men, though not equally ſtrong in all Men, as our Inclination for the Preſervation of our Being, and of thoſe that are united to us by Nature, are alſo Impreſſions of the Will of God upon us; for in this place I give promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly the Name of Natural Inclinations to all the Impreſſions of the Author of Nature, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all Minds.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:60613:210"/>
                  <p>I ſaid but even now, that God loved his Creatures,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>The Source of the Chief Natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which will make up the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of this fourth Book.</hi>
                     </note> and alſo that it was his Love which gave them to exiſt, and did preſerve their Being: Therefore as God continually imprints in us a Love like unto his, ſince it is his Will which makes and which regulates ours; he likewiſe gives us all thoſe Natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which are not at our Choice, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline us of neceſſity to the Preſervation of our Being, and of thoſe we live with.</p>
                  <p>For, though Sin has Corrupted all things, it has not deſtroy'd them. Although our Natural Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions do not always propoſe God as their End by the Free Choice of our Will, God is always their Object in the Inſtitution of Nature: For God who produces and preſerves them in us, only produces and preſerves them for himſelf. All Sinners tend towards God by the Impreſſion they receive from God, though they withdraw from him by the Error and Diſtraction of their Mind. They love Good, for we can never love otherwiſe, ſince God makes us Love; but they Love ill Objects, Ill only, becauſe God, who gives even Sinners the Power of Loving, forbids their Loving them, becauſe ſince the Fall they withdraw their Affection from him. For Men imagining that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures occaſion in them the Pleaſure they injoy upon their account, incline their Affections violently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Body, and fall into an abſolute Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of God, who does not appear before their Eyes.</p>
                  <p>We have ſtill then the ſame Natural Inclinations, or the ſame Impreſſions of the Author of Nature which <hi>Adam</hi> had before the Fall. We have even the ſame Inclinations which the Bleſſed have in Heaven, for God neither Creates nor Preſerves any Creatures, without giving them a Love like unto his. He Loves himſelf, he Loves us, he Loves all his Creatures: Therefore he Inclines all Humane Minds to Love him, to Love themſelves, and to Love all Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But were as all our Inclinations are only Impreſſions of the Author of Nature, which incline us to Love him and all things for his ſake; they cannot be right
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60613:211"/>unleſs we love God with all our Power, and all things for his ſake, by the Free Choice of our Will: For we cannot, without Injuſtice, abuſe the Love God gives us for himſelf, by applying it to any thing but himſelf, or which has no relation to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thus we are now ſenſible, not only what our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclinations are, but alſo what they ought to be; in order to be well regulated, and according to the Inſtitution of their Author. For all the Diſorder of our Inclinations conſiſts, in that we place our final End in our ſelves; and that inſtead of doing all things in relation to God, we do all things in relation to our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>We have then, in the firſt place, an Inclination for good in General, which is the Principle of all our Natural Inclinations, of all our Paſſions, and of all the Free Actions of our Will.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We have an Inclination for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Being, and of our Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We have all an Inclination for the other Creatures, when they are of uſe to us, or to thoſe we Love. Moreover, we have ſeveral other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Inclinations which depend on theſe; but we ſhall ſpeak of them elſewhere. We only deſign in this Fourth Book, to refer the Errors of our Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to theſe three Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> To the Inclination we have to Good in General, To Self-Love, And to the Love of our Neighbour.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THat vaſt Capacity which the Will has for all Good in General,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination for Good in General, is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Diſquiet of our Will.</hi>
                     </note> becauſe it is only form'd by a Good which includes all Good in it ſelf, cannot be ſatisfied by all the things which the Mind repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to it; and yet that continual Motion which God imprints in it towards Good cannot ſtand ſtill. This Motion never ceaſing, puts the Mind, of neceſſity, into a continual Agitation. The Will which ſeeks what it deſires, obliges the Mind to repreſent all ſorts of Objects to it ſelf. The Mind accordingly does it, but the Soul does not reliſh them; or if it does, is not ſatisfied with them. The Soul does not reliſh them, by reaſon that often the Perception of the Mind is not accompanied with Pleaſure; for it is through Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the Soul reliſhes its Good: And the Soul is not ſatisfied with it, by reaſon that nothing can ſtop the Motion of the Soul but him that gives it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Mind repreſents to it ſelf as its Good, is Finite; and whatever is Finite, may withdraw our Love for a while, but it cannot fix it. When the Mind conſiders very new and uncommon Objects, or that have ſome relation to Infinity, the Will permits the Mind to examine them a while with ſome Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in hopes of finding what it is in ſearch of, becauſe whatever appears Infinite, bears the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of its real Good; but in time it grows weary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60613:212"/>of it, as well as of the reſt. Therefore the Will is always diſquieted, becauſe it is inclin'd to ſeek for that which it can never find, and which it always hopes to find: It Loves whatever is Great and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, and reſembles Infinity; for not having found its real Good in Common and Familiar things, it hopes to find it in ſuch as are unknown to it. We will demonſtrate in this Chapter, that the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet of our Wills is one of the principal Cauſes of our Ignorance, and of the Errors into which we fall in many things: And in the two following we will explain what it is that produces in us the Inclination we have for every thing that has ſomething Great or Extraordinary in it.</p>
                  <p>It is ſomething evident by what has been ſaid,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                     </note> Firſt, That the Will ſeldom makes uſe of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs on Objects that have ſome Relation to us, and that it very much neglects all others; for being ever earneſtly deſirous of Felicity, by the Impreſſion of Nature, it only turns the Underſtanding towards ſuch things as ſeem to be of uſe to us, and which do in ſome meaſure pleaſe us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Will does not permit the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding to apply it ſelf long even to ſuch things as it is delighted with: Becauſe, as we have already ſaid, all things that are created may indeed pleaſe us for a while, but we are ſoon diſguſted with them; and then our Mind lays them by, to ſeek for that which can ſatisfie it elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Will is excited thus to make the Mind run from Object to Object, becauſe it never ceaſes to repreſent conſuſedly to it, or as at a diſtance, that which includes all Beings in it ſelf, as we have declared in the Third Book. For the Will being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous, as it were, to draw its real Good near to it ſelf, to be pleaſed with it, and to receive from it the Motion which animates it, it excites the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to repreſent that Good in ſome meaſure. But then it is no longer the General, the Univerſal, the Infinitely Perfect Being which the Mind perceives; it is ſomething that is Bounded and Imperfect, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60613:212"/>not being able to ſtop the Motion of the Will, nor to pleaſe it long, it forſakes it to turn after ſome other Object.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the Attention and Application of the Mind are abſolutely neceſſary to diſcover abſtracted Truths, it is evident that the common ſort of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind muſt live in a groſs Ignorance, in reſpect even of ſuch things as have ſome relation to them; and that it is impoſſible to expreſs their Blindneſs in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to abſtracted Truths, and which have no ſenſible relation to them. But we muſt endeavour to prove theſe things by Examples.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt all Sciences Morality has moſt relation to us: It teaches us all our Duty towards God,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Firſt Example, Morality little known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many Men.</hi>
                     </note> towards our Prince, towards our Friends and Relations, and generally towards all that are about us. Moreover it teaches us the way to be Eternally Happy; and all Men lie under an Eſſential Obligation, or rather Indiſpenſible Neceſſity, to apply themſelves wholly to it: And yet though there have been Men on Earth theſe Six Thouſand Years, that Science is ſtill very Imperfect.</p>
                  <p>That part of Morality which relates to our Duty towards God, and which undoubtedly is the chief, ſince it relates to Eternity, has hardly been known by the moſt Learned; and even in our days we find Men of Sence who are unacquainted with it; and yet it is the eaſieſt part of Morality. For in the firſt place, Where lies the Difficulty to diſcover that there is a God? Whatever God has made proves it: Whatever Men or Beaſts do, proves it: Whatever we think, whatever we ſee, whatever we feel, proves it. In a word, There is nothing but what proves the Exiſtence of God, or that may prove it to attentive Minds, who apply themſelves ſeriouſly to the Knowledge of the Author of all Things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is evident, that there is a Neceſſity to follow the Commands of God to be Happy; for as he is Powerful and Juſt, we cannot diſobey him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being Puniſh'd, nor obey him without being Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded. But what is it he exacts from us? That
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60613:213"/>we ſhould Love him; That our Mind ſhould be taken up with him; That our Hearts ſhould be turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. For wherefore has he Created our Minds? Certainly he can do nothing but for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Therefore he has made us for himſelf only; and we are Indiſpenſibly obliged not to apply elſewhere the Impreſſion of that Love which he continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in us, in order that we ſhould continually Love him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Truths are eaſily diſcovered with little Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: And yet this only Principle of Morality, which teaches us, that to be Vertuous and Happy, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary to Love God above all Things and in all Things, is the Foundation of all Chriſtian Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Neither does it require an extraordinary Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Mind, to draw from thence all the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences we ſtand in need of, to ſettle the general Rules of our Conduct; though there are but very few that do it; and Men continually diſpute upon Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions of Morality, which are the Immediate and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Conſequences of a Principle which is ſo evident as that is.</p>
                  <p>The Profeſſors of Geometry daily makes new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, but if they do not bring it to a greater Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it is becauſe they have already drawn the moſt Uſeful and Neceſſary Conſequences out of their Principles. But moſt Men ſeem Incapable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding any thing out of the firſt Principle of Morality. All their Idea's vaniſh, and are diſſipated as ſoon as they begin to think upon it; becauſe they will not do it as they ſhould do; and they will not do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not reliſh it, or becauſe they are too ſoon tired with it after their having reliſh'd it. That Principle is abſtracted, Metaphyſical, meerly Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it is not obvious, it is not to be imagined; and therefore it does not appear ſolid to Carnal Minds, or to Minds that only ſee with the Eyes. Nothing is found in that Principle capable of putting a ſtop to the Diſquiets of their Will, and afterwards to fix the Eyes of their Mind to conſider it with ſome Attention. What Hopes then of their ſeeing it as they ſhould
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60613:213"/>do, of their apprehending it rightly, and of their concluding directly from thence what they ſhould Conclude?</p>
                  <p>If Men had but an Imperfect Apprehenſion of that Propoſition of Geometry: That the ſides of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles that are alike, are proportionable one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; certainly they would not be great Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians. But if beſides the Confuſed and Imperfect Idea of that Fundamental Propoſition of Geometry, they alſo had ſome Intereſt to wiſh, that the ſides of Triangles that are alike were not proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and that falſe Geometry were as convenient for their Perverſe Inclinations as falſe Morality, they might very well be guilty of Paralogiſms as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in Geometry as in Morality, becauſe their Errors would pleaſe them, and that Truth would only Puzzle, Diſturb and Vex them.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we need not wonder at the Blindneſs of thoſe that lived in the former Ages, whilſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry reigned in the World, or of thoſe that live in our Days, and that do not as yet enjoy the Benefit of the Light of the Goſpel. It was neceſſary for Divine Wiſdom to make it ſelf ſenſible at laſt, to inſtruct ſuch Men as only conſult their Senſes. Truth had ſpoken to their Minds for above the ſpace of Four thouſand Years, but whereas they never look'd Inwardly they did not underſtand it: It was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that it ſhould ſpeak to their Ears. The Light which directs all Men, did ſhine in their Darkneſs, without being able to expel it; they could not ſo much as look upon it. It was neceſſary that the Intelligible Light ſhould put on a Veil to make it ſelf viſible: And that the <hi>Word</hi> ſhould cloath it ſelf with Fleſh; and that the Wiſdom of God which lay conceal'd, and was inacceſſible to Carnal Men, ſhould inſtruct them in a Carnal way, <hi>Carnaliter,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Bernard.</hi> The Majority of Men,

                     </note> and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Poor (which are the moſt worthy Objects of the Mercy and Providence of the Creator,) who are obliged to work for their daily Bread, are very Ignorant and Stupid, They only Hear becauſe they
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60613:214"/>have Ears, and they only ſee becauſe they have Eyes. They are incapable of looking Inwardly by an Effort of Mind, there to Interrogate Truth in the Silence of their Senſes and Paſſions. They cannot apply themſelves to Truth, by reaſon that they cannot reliſh it: Moreover they ſeldom think of applying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, becauſe Men ſeldom have any Thoughts of applying themſelves to things that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them. Their unquiet and unſettled Will turns their Minds continually towards all the Objects that Pleaſe and Divert them by their Variety: For the Multiplicity and Diverſity of Senſible Goods, hinder Men from diſcovering the Vanity of them, and ſtill keep them in hopes of finding the real Good they deſire in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus though the Councils which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as Man, as the way, as the Author of our Faith, gives us in the Goſpel, are much more ſuitable to the Weakneſs of our Underſtanding, than thoſe which the ſame <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as Eternal Wiſdom, as Inward Truth, as Intelligible Light Inſpires into the moſt ſecret Receſſes of our Reaſon: Though <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> renders thoſe Councils Agreeable by his Grace, Senſible by his Example, Convincing by his Miracles, yet Men are ſo ſtupid, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of Reflection, even upon things which are abſolutely Neceſſary for them to know well, that they hardly ever think on them as they ought. Few Men obſerve the Beauty of the Goſpel; Few Men conceive the Solidity and Neceſſity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Few Meditate upon them; Few eſteem them as their Neceſſary Food, or fortifie themſelves with them; the Continual Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Will, which is in ſearch of the Taſte of Good,
<note place="margin">IV. <hi>Second Example, The Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the Soul, diſputed by ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
                     </note> not permitting the Mind to be intent upon Truths which ſeem to deprive it thereof. Take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Example.</p>
                  <p>It concerns the Impious highly to make a very ſtrict enquiry, whether their Soul is Mortal, as they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it, or whether it is Immortal, as Faith and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tells us. It is a thing of the utmoſt Conſequence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60613:214"/>for them to know; their Eternity is concerned in it, and the very Quiet of their Mind depends upon it. Why is it then they do not know it, or that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in doubt, unleſs it be that they are not capable of the leaſt ſerious Application; and that their unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date and corrupted Will does not allow their Mind to look ſtedfaſtly on the Reaſons which are contrary to theſe Opinions, which they deſire ſhould be true? For in fine, is it ſo difficult a task to diſtinguiſh the difference there is between the Soul and the Body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween what thinks, and what is extended? Do's it require ſo great an Attention of Mind to diſcover that a Thought is neither Round nor Square: That Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is only capable of different Figures and different Motions, and not of Thought and Reaſoning: And conſequently, that what Thinks, and what is Extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are two Beings directly oppoſite to one another? Yet that alone is ſufficient to demonſtrate that the Soul is Immortal, and that it cannot Periſh, even though the Body were Annihilated.</p>
                  <p>When a Subſtance periſhes, it is true that the Modes or Manners of Exiſtence of that Subſtance periſh with it. If a piece of Wax were annihilated, it is certain that the Forms of that Wax ſhould alſo be annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated with it; becauſe the Roundneſs for Example of the Wax, is in Effect nothing but the Wax it ſelf of ſuch a Shape, and therefore it cannot ſubſiſt without the Wax. But though God ſhould deſtroy all the Wax in the World, it would not therefore follow, that any other Subſtance, nor that the <hi>Modes</hi> of any other Subſtance were Annihilated. All the Stones for example, would ſubſiſt with all their <hi>Modes;</hi> becauſe Stones are Subſtances or Beings, and not Modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of the Wax.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, though God ſhould Annihilate one half of ſome Bodies, it would not follow, that the other half ſhould be Annihilated. This laſt half is United with the other, but it is not one with it. Thus one half being Annihilated, it follows indeed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Reaſon, that the other half has no longer any relation to it; but it do's not follow that it ceaſes to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60613:215"/>be; becauſe as its Being is different, it cannot be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated by the Annihilation of the other. Therefore it is clear, that the Thought not being the Modification of Extenſion, our Soul is not Annihilated, though we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Body were Annihilated by Death.</p>
                  <p>But there is no reaſon to believe, that even the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is Annihilated when it is deſtroy'd. The parts which Compoſe it are diſſipated into Vapours, and reduc'd to Powder: They are no longer ſeen, nor are they any longer known; this is true, but it is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude, that they are no longer in Being; for the Mind perceives them ſtill. Dividing a Grain of Muſtard into Two, into Four, or Twenty parts, it would be Annihilated to our ſight, becauſe it would be no longer ſeen: But it would not be Annihilated in it ſelf, nor yet to the Mind; for the Mind would ſee it, though it were divided into a Thouſand, or an Hundred Thouſand Parts.</p>
                  <p>'Tis a common Notion among Men who conſult their Reaſon more than their Senſes, that nothing can be Annihilated by the common force of Nature; for as Naturally, nothing can be made out of nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can a Subſtance or Being become nothing. Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be corrupted, if we may call the Alterations they are liable to, Corruption; but they cannot be Annihilated. What is Round may become Square, What is Fleſh may become Earth, Vapour, and what you pleaſe; for all ſorts of Extenſions are capable of all manner of Configurations: But the Subſtance of what is Round, and of what is Fleſh, cannot periſh. There are certain Laws Eſtabliſh'd in Nature, according to which Bodies change their Forms ſucceſſively; for thoſe Succeſſive Forms Compoſe the Beauty of the Univerſe, and Create an Admiration in us for its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: But there is no Law in Nature for the Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of any Being, becauſe Annihilation has nothing of Beauty or Good in it ſelf, and becauſe the Author of Nature loves his Work. Therefore Bodies may Alter, but they cannot Periſh.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:60613:215"/>
                  <p>But if relying on the Teſtimony of the Senſes, Men would maintain obſtinately that the Reduction of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is a real Annihilation, by reaſon that the Parts into which they are reduc'd are Imperceptible: Let them remember at leaſt, that Bodies can only be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into thoſe Imperceptible Parts, becauſe they are Extended. But if the Mind is not Extended, it will not be Diviſible; and if it be not Diviſible, it muſt be granted, that in that Senſe it will not be Corruptible. But how could any Body imagin that the Mind were Extended and Diviſible? We may by a <hi>right Line</hi> cut a <hi>Square</hi> into two <hi>Triangles,</hi> into two <hi>Paralelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammes,</hi> or long Squares, into two <hi>Trapeza's:</hi> But by what <hi>Line</hi> can it be conceiv'd, that a Pleaſure, a Pain, or a Deſire can be Cut? And what Figure would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of that Diviſion? Truly I cannot think, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination can be fruitful enough in falſe Idea's, to ſatisfie it ſelf upon that Subject.</p>
                  <p>The Mind then is not Extended, conſequently it is not Diviſible: It is not liable to the ſame Alterations as the Body: Nevertheleſs, it muſt be granted that it is not Immutable by its Nature. If the Body is capable of an infinite number of different Figures, and of different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurations, the Mind is capable of an infinite number of different Idea's, and different Modifications. As after our Death the ſubſtance of our Fleſh will be reduc'd to Earth, to Vapours, and to an infinite number of other Bodies without being Annihilated: So our Souls without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again reduc'd to nothing, will have Thoughts, and Sentiments very different from thoſe they had in Life. It is alſo neceſſary while we are alive, that our Body ſhould be Compos'd of Fleſh and Bones: It is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to Live, that our Soul ſhould have the Idea's and Sentiments it has, in relation to the Body to which it is united. But when the Soul ſhall be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from its Body, it will be at full Liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all ſorts of Idea's and Modifications, very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from thoſe it has at preſent; as our Body on its part, will be capable of receiving all ſorts of Figures and Configurations, very different from thoſe it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it ſhould have, to be the Body of a Living Man.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:60613:216"/>
                  <p>What I have ſaid, does in my Opinion, ſufficiently ſhow, that the Immortality of the Soul is not a thing ſo difficult to be apprehended. What then is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that ſo many queſtion it, unleſs it be, that they are unwilling to apply themſelves as much as may be, to examin the Reaſons which prove it, in order to be Convinc'd? And why is it that they are unwilling to do it, unleſs it be that their Will, being uneaſie and inconſtant, keeps their Underſtanding in a continual Agitation; inſomuch that it is not at leiſure diſtinctly to perceive thoſe very Idea's which are moſt preſent to it, as thoſe of Thought and of Extenſion? Juſt like a Man agitated by ſome Paſſion, turning his Eyes continually on all ſides, for the moſt part does not diſtinguiſh the neareſt Objects, and the moſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to his Sight. For indeed the Queſtion about the Immortality of the Soul, is one of the eaſieſt Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to reſolve, when without Conſulting our Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, we conſider with ſome Attention of Mind, the clear and diſtinct Idea of Extenſion, and the Relation it can have to Thought.</p>
                  <p>If the Inconſtancy and Levity of our Will does not permit our Underſtanding to penetrate into the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of things which are preſent to it, and which we are highly concern'd to know; it is eaſie to judge, that it will be more averſe to let us meditate on thoſe that are diſtant, and which have no relation to us. So that if we are very Ignorant of moſt of thoſe things which it is very neceſſary for us to know, we ſhall not have a great Inſight into thoſe which ſeem abſolutely vain and uſeleſs to us.</p>
                  <p>It will not be neceſſary for me to endeavour to prove this by tedious Examples, which have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Truths in them; for if we may be allow'd to be Ignorant of any thing, it is of thoſe things which are of no Uſe. And I had rather not be believed, than to make the Reader loſe his Time in reading things that are wholly uſeleſs.</p>
                  <p>Though there are not many perſons who apply themſelves ſeriouſly to things abſolutely Vain and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yet the number of them is but too great: But
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60613:216"/>there can never be too many of thoſe who do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to them, and who deſpiſe them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they do not pretend to Judge of them. It is no defect in a limited Mind, not to know certain things; it is only a defect to pretend to Judge of them. Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is a neceſſary Evil, but we may, and ought to avoid Error. Therefore I do not condemn Men for being Ignorant of many things, but only for giving raſh Judgments about thoſe things.</p>
                  <p>When things have a great relation to us, are ſenſible,
<note place="margin">V <hi>That our Ignorance is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great in reſpect of abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things, or ſuch as have but little rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us.</hi>
                     </note> and fall eaſily within the Compaſs of our Imagination, we may ſay, that the Mind applies it ſelf to them, and may have ſome knowledge of them. For when we know that things have a relation to us, we think upon them with ſome Inclination; and when we find that they concern us, we apply our ſelves to them with pleaſure. So that we ſhould be more Learned than we are in many things, if the uneaſineſs and toſſing of our Will did not Diſturb and Fatigue our Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion continually.</p>
                  <p>But when things are abſtract, and not very ſenſible, it is difficult to attain any certain knowledge of them: Not that abſtracted things are very intricate, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Attention and Sight of the Mind begins, and Ends commonly with the ſenſible Proſpect of Objects; for we ſeldom think on any thing but what we ſee and feel, and only as long as we ſee and feel it.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt certain, that if the Mind could eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it ſelf to clear and diſtinct Idea's, without being any-wiſe byaſs'd by Opinion; and if the uneaſineſs of the Will did not continually diſturb its Application, we ſhould meet no great difficulties in many Natural Queſtions, which we look upon as not to be Explain'd, and we might eaſily be deliver'd of our Ignorance and Errors in relation to them.</p>
                  <p>For Example; It is an undeniable Truth to any Man of Senſe, that Creation and Annihilation are things which ſurpaſs the common force of Nature. Therefore if Men did remain Attentive to that pure Notion of the Mind and Reaſon, they would not ſo eaſily admit the Creation and Annihilation of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60613:217"/>Number of New Beings, as of Subſtantial Forms, real Qualities and Faculties. They would look into the diſtinct Idea's we have of Extenſion, Figure, and Motion, for the reaſon of Natural Effects; which is not always ſo difficult as People imagin; all things in Nature are ſo connected together, and prove each other.</p>
                  <p>The Effects of Fire, as thoſe of Canon and of Mines, are very Surpriſing; and their cauſe not very well known. Nevertheleſs, if Men inſtead of rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Impreſſions of their Senſes, and on ſome falſe or deceitful Experiments, did firmly fix on that bare Notion of the Mind alone: That it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Body that is very little agitated to produce a violent Motion, ſince it can communicate no more moving Power than it has its ſelf; it would be eaſie from that alone to conclude, that there is a Subtle and Inviſible Matter, that it is very much agitated, and diſpers'd inth all Bodies, and ſeveral other like things which would teach us the Nature of Fire, and alſo be of great uſe to us to diſcover other Truths yet more conceal'd.</p>
                  <p>For, ſince Canons and Mines have ſuch great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and all the Viſible Bodies about them, are not in a ſufficient Agitation to produce them; it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain proof that there are other Inviſible and Inſenſible Bodies, which have at leaſt as much Agitation as the Canon Ball: But with being very Subtle and Thin, may alone freely paſs, and without breaking through the Pores of the Canon before it is Fir'd; that is, as <hi>Monſieur Deſcartes</hi> has explain'd it more at large, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their having ſurrounded the hard and groſs parts of the Salt-petre, of which the Powder is Compos'd. But when the Fire is put to it, that is, when thoſe ſubtle and extreamly agitated Particles, have ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the groſs and ſolid Parts of the Salt-petre, and have thus Communicated their very ſtrong and violent Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, then all does Burſt of neceſſity; becauſe the Pores of the Canon, which left an open paſſage on all ſides for the ſubtle Parts before mention'd, while they were alone, are not large enough to make way for the groſs Parts of the Salt-petre, and ſome others
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60613:217"/>of which the Powder is Compos'd, when they have receiv'd into themſelves the Agitation of the Subtle Parts which ſurrounds them.</p>
                  <p>For as the Water of Rivers which flows under Bridges does not ſhake them, by reaſon of the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its Particles: Thus the very ſubtle and very thin Matter I have mention'd, paſſes continually through the Pores of all Bodies without making any ſenſible Alterations in them. But then likewiſe, as the ſaid River is capable of breaking down a Bridge, when carrying along with it ſome great Flakes of Ice, or ſome other more ſolid Bodies, by forcing them againſt it with its own Motion; ſo ſubtle Matter is capable of producing the ſurpriſing Effects we ſee in Canons and in Mines; when having communicated to the Parts of the Powder which Float in the midſt of it, its Motion which is infinitely more Violent, and more Rapid than that of Rivers and Torrents; the ſaid Parts of the Powder cannot freely paſs through the Pores of the Bodies which encloſe them, by reaſon they are too groſs; ſo that they violently break them to force them a free Paſſage.</p>
                  <p>But Men do not eaſily apprehend thoſe ſubtle ſmall Particles, which they repute Chimera's, becauſe they do not ſee them. <hi>Contemplatio ferè definit cum aſpectu,</hi> ſays <hi>Bacon.</hi> The greater part even of Philoſophers, invent ſome New Entity, rather than not to talk upon thoſe matters which they are Ignorant of: And if any Body objects againſt their falſe and incomprehenſible Suppoſitions, that Fire muſt needs be compos'd of Parts that are in very great Agitation, ſince it produces ſuch Violent Motions, and that a thing cannot Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate that which it has not; which is undoubtedly a moſt clear, and moſt ſolid Objection: They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found all by ſome frivolous Imaginary diſtinction, as that of Equivocal and Univocal Cauſes, in order to ſeem to ſay ſomething, though in reality they ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. For it is a general Notion among Men of Senſe and Learning, that there can be no real Equivocal Cauſe in Nature; and that it has been invented meerly by the Ignorance of Men.</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60613:218"/>
                  <p>Therefore Men muſt apply themſelves more to the conſideration of clear and diſtinct Notions, if they have a mind to underſtand Nature: They muſt check and ſtop the Inconſtancy and Levity of their Will a little, if they deſign to penetrate deeply into things; for their Mind will ever be weak, ſuperficial and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſive, while their Will remains Light, Inconſtant and Roving.</p>
                  <p>It is true, it requires ſome Fatigue, and Men muſt conſtrain themſelves to become Attentive, and to ſearch into the bottom of things; for there is nothing to be got without pains. It is ſhameful for Men of Senſe, and Philoſophers, who are obliged by all manner of reaſons to enquire into, and to defend Truth, to ſpeak without knowing what they ſay, and to be ſatisfy'd with what they do not underſtand.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>AS long as Men have an Inclination for a Good which ſurpaſſes their Power,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Curioſity is natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</hi>
                     </note> and do not poſſeſs it, they will have a ſecret propenſion for whatever looks new and extraordinary: They will ever run after ſuch things as they have not as yet conſidered, in hopes of finding what they enquire after; and their Mind not being able to ſatisfie it ſelf wholly without the enjoyment of that Good for which they are made; they will ever remain uneaſie, and in a continual Agitation, until it appears to them in its Glory.</p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition of Human Minds is certainly very ſuitable to their Condition; for it is infinitely better to be uneaſie, and in ſearch of the Happineſs one does not poſſeſs, than to remain in a falſe Repoſe, and to be pleas'd with falſhood, and a deluſive Happineſs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60613:218"/>wherewith Men are commonly deluded. We ought to have a ſenſe of Truth, and of our Happineſs: Therefore thoſe Things that are new and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary muſt excite us: There is a certain kind of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity which is not only allowable, but abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; for whereas common and ordinary things can never afford true Felicity, and the ancient Opinions of Philoſophers are very uncertain: It is neceſſary we ſhould be curious for New Diſcoveries, and always uneaſie in the Enjoyment of common Felicities.</p>
                  <p>Should a Geometrician give us New Propoſitions contrary to thoſe of <hi>Euclide,</hi> Should he undertake to prove, that that Science is full of Errors, as <hi>Hobbs</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to do in a Book, written againſt the Pride of Geometricians, I own that there would be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to complain of that kind of Novelty; becauſe, that when we have found out the Truth we ought to ſtick to it, ſince we are only endu'd with Curioſity in order to find it out? Neither are Geometricians often guilty of being Curious of New Opinions of Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They would ſoon be tir'd with a Book contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but Propoſitions contrary to thoſe of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clide;</hi> for being fully convinc'd of the Truth of thoſe Propoſitions by unanſwerable Demonſtrations, our Curioſity ceaſes in that Point: Which is an infallible Argument, that the only reaſon of the Inclination of Men after Novelty, is becauſe they do not evidently ſee the Truth of thoſe things they naturally deſire to know, nor poſſeſs Infinite Felicity, which they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally deſirous to poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is neceſſary that Novelty ſhould Excite Men, and that they ſhould Love it: But however,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Three Rules to moderate Curioſity.</hi>
                     </note> there are Exceptions to be made, and they muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve certain Rules which it is eaſie to infer from what we have been ſaying, that the Inclination we have for Novelty is only given us in order to ſeek out Truth, and our real Felicity.</p>
                  <p>There are Three, the firſt of which is, That Men muſt not be fond of Novelty in things relating to Faith which are not ſubmitted to Reaſon</p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:60613:219"/>
                  <p>The Second, That Novelty is not a ſufficient Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to induce us to believe that things are Good or True: That is, We muſt not fancy that Opinions are true becauſe they are new; nor that any thing can be capable to content us, becauſe it is new or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or becauſe we have not poſſeſs'd it before.</p>
                  <p>The Third, That when we are ſatisfy'd that Truths are ſo conceal'd that it is morally impoſſible to diſcover them, and that Benefits are ſo little, and ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable that they cannot ſatisfie us, we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be excited by the Novelty of them, nor to be ſeduc'd by falſe hopes. But it is neceſſary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain theſe Rules more at large; and ſhew how by a neglect of 'em we fall into an infinite number of Errors.</p>
                  <p>We often meet with Minds of very different Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours:
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the firſt of thoſe Rules.</hi>
                     </note> Some believe every thing blindly: Others will never believe without ſeeing evidently. The firſt having hardly ever made any uſe of their Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do without conſidering, believe whatever is ſaid to them; the others, who will truſt to nothing but their Underſtanding, indifferently condemn all ſorts of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities. The firſt are commonly ſtupid and weak Perſons, like Children and Women; the others are proud and profane Diſpoſitions, like Hereticks and Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p>It is very difficult to find Perſons who keep a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between thoſe two Extreams, and who never look for Evidence in matters relating to Faith through a vain Agitation of Mind, or who ſometimes believe falſe Opinions without Evidence, in things relating to Nature, through an indiſcreet Deference, and low Submiſſion of Mind. If they are Perſons of Piety, who ſubmit to the Authority of the Church in all things, their Faith extends ſometimes, if I may uſe the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, even to Opinions that are meerly Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and they often look upon them with the ſame Reſpect as is only due to the Truths of Religion. A falſe Zeal makes them too eaſily condemn thoſe that are not of their Opinion. They harbour injurious Suſpicions againſt thoſe that make New Diſcoveries.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60613:219"/>It is ſufficient to be eſteem'd by them as Libertines, to deny that there are ſubſtantial Forms, that Animals are ſenſible of Pain and Pleaſure, and other Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Opinions, which they look upon as Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any evident Reaſon, only becauſe they imagin there are neceſſary Relations between thoſe Opinions and the Truths of Faith.</p>
                  <p>But if they are Perſons that are too bold, their Pride induces them to deſpiſe the Authority of the Church; they never ſubmit willingly to it. They delight in difficult raſh Opinions: They affect to paſs for migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Wits; and upon that account they ſpeak of Divine Myſteries without Reſpect, and with a kind of Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs: They deſpiſe all as Credulous, who ſpeak mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly of certain receiv'd Opinions. Finally, they are very much inclin'd to doubt of every thing, and are directly oppos'd to thoſe who are too eaſily inclin'd to ſubmit to the Authority of Men.</p>
                  <p>It is obvious, that theſe two Extreams are bad, and thoſe who will not admit Evidence in Natural Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are blameable, as well as thoſe who would have Evidence in Myſteries of Faith. But yet thoſe who Expoſe themſelves to be miſtaken in Philoſophical Queſtions in being too Credulous, are without doubt more excuſable than the others who run the hazard of falling into ſome Hereſie or other in doubting Raſhly. For it is leſs dangerous to fall into a World of Errors in Philoſophy for want of examining them, than to fall into one Hereſie for want of ſubmitting with Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility to the Authority of the Church.</p>
                  <p>The Mind is at quiet when it meets Evidence, and is in continual Agitation when it finds none. Becauſe Evidence is the Character of Truth. Thus the Error of Libertines, and of Hereticks, proceeds from their doubting of the Truth of the Deciſions of the Church, becauſe they are not Evident, and they hope that the Truths of Faith may be demonſtrated. Now their Love for Novelty is Irregular, ſince that poſſeſſing the Truth in the Faith of the Church, they ought not to ſeek farther: Beſides, the Truths of Faith being far above the reach of their Underſtanding, they would
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60613:220"/>not be able to diſcover them, ſuppoſing that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their Falſe Opinion, the Church were guilty of Error.</p>
                  <p>But if there are many who deceive themſelves in refuſing to ſubmit to the Authority of the Church, there are as many who are deceiv'd in ſubmitting to the Authority of Men. We muſt ſubmit to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church, becauſe it can never ſubmit Blindly to the Authority of Men, becauſe they are always liable to Miſtakes. What the Church teaches us, is Infinitely above the reach of Reaſon: What Men teach us, is ſubmitted to our Reaſon: So that as it is a Crime, and an Inſupportable Vanity, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find out the Truth in Matters of Faith by our Reaſon, without regarding the Authority of the Church: So it is a great Indiſcretion, and a deſpicable poorneſs of Spirit, to rely blindly on the Authority of Men, in Things which relate to Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, moſt of thoſe that are eſteem'd Learned Men in the World, have only acquir'd that Reputation, by knowing the Opinions of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> and of ſome other Philoſophers by Heart, by ſubmitting blindly to their Sentiments, and by defending them with Obſtinacy. In order to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Reputation of Learning in the Univerſities, it is ſufficient to be acquainted with the Sentiments of ſome Philoſopher: Provided they will Swear <hi>In Verba Magiſtri,</hi> they ſoon become Doctors. Moſt Communities ſtick to a peculiar Doctrine, which the Members are not allow'd to deviate from. What is True in ſome, is often Falſe in others. They are ſometimes Proud of defending the Doctrine of their Order, againſt Reaſon and Experience; and they think themſelves oblig'd to wreſt the Truth, or their Authors to reconcile them: This produces a World of Frivolous Diſtinctions, which are ſo many by ways, that lead Infallibly to Error.</p>
                  <p>If any Truth is diſcover'd, even in our days, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> muſt have ſeen it; or if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> be againſt it, the Diſcovery muſt be Falſe. Some make that Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſpeak one way, others another; for all thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60613:220"/>who pretend to Learning, make him ſpeak their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: He is made the Author of all ſorts of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies, and few Diſcoveries are made, which are not found Enigmatically in ſome corner or other of his Books. In a word, he is ever contradicting himſelf, if not in his Works, yet at leaſt in the Mouths of thoſe that teach him. For though Philoſophers proteſt, and even pretend to teach his Doctrine, it is difficult to meet two that agree about his Sentiments: For indeed <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Books are ſo Obſcure, and fill'd with ſuch rambling general Terms, that one may with ſome Appearance of Truth, impute to him the Opinions of thoſe that are moſt oppoſite to his. It is eaſie to make him ſay whatever one has a mind to in ſome of his Works, becauſe he hardly ſays any thing in them, though he makes a great deal of Noiſe; as Children ſuppoſe the Sounds of the Bells to ſay what they pleaſe, becauſe they make a great deal of Noiſe and ſay nothing.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs that it ſeems very Rational to fix and to ſtop the Mind on ſome particular Opinions, to hinder it from running out into Extravagancies. But what then? Muſt it needs be done by Falſhood and Error? Or rather can any one believe that Error can fix the Mind? Let Men examine how difficult it is to find Perſons of Senſe pleaſed with the reading of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and that can perſwade themſelves they have acquir'd any true Science, even after having grown old on his Books; and it will appear plainly, that nothing but Truth and Evidence can fix the Agitations of the Mind; and that Diſputes, Averſions, Errors and even Hereſies, are entertain'd and encourag'd by an Ill Manner of Study. Truth conſiſts in Individuality, it is not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Variety; and nothing beſides it can reconcile Peoples Minds: Falſhood and Error only ſerve to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide and agitate them.</p>
                  <p>I do not queſtion but there are ſome who do verily believe, that he they call the Prince of Philoſophers, is no-wiſe in an Error, and that Real and Solid Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy are only to be found in his Works. There are ſome who fancy, that though it is Two thouſand
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60613:221"/>Years ſince <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> wrote, no body has yet been able to diſcover that he was guilty of any Error; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently being in ſome reſpects Infallible, they may boldly follow him, and quote him as ſuch. But I do not think it worth my while to anſwer ſuch Perſons, becauſe their Ignorance is ſo groſs, that it only deſerves Contempt. I only deſire them to tell me, whether <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or any of his Diſciples, have ever deduced any Truths from the Principles of Natural Philoſophy which may be called his; or if they, or any of them, have done it themſelves, let them declare it, let them explain it, and let them prove it; and we do engage our ſelves, never more to ſpeak of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> without an Elogy; we will no longer ſay, that his Principles are Uſeleſs, ſince they have ſerved to prove one Truth; but there is no reaſon to expect it. They were long ſince challeng'd to do it, and particularly by Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> in his Metaphyſical Meditations about Forty Years ago, even with a Promiſe to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Falſity of that Pretended Truth: And there is no great likelihood to believe, that any body will ever preſume to do, what Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> greateſt Enemies, and the moſt Zealous Defenders of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi>'s Philoſophy, have not hitherto dar'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I hope I may preſume to ſay, that it is a ſtrange Blindneſs, Poorneſs of Mind, and Stupidity of Spirit, thus to ſubmit to the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> or of any other Philoſopher whatever: That People loſe their time in reading them, when their only Deſign is to get their Opinions by Heart; and thoſe that teach them make their Diſciples loſe theirs likewiſe. Therefore give me leave to ſay with St. <hi>Auſtin,

                  </argument>
                  <p>THE Second Rule that muſt be obſerv'd, is,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Second Rule of Curloſity.</hi>
                     </note> That Novelty muſt never ſerve as a Reaſon to believe that things are True. We have already ſaid ſeveral times, that Men muſt not reſt in Error, and in the Falſe Felicities they enjoy: That it is neceſſary they ſhould Search after the Evidence of Truth, and the real Felicity they do not poſſeſs; and conſequently that they ſhould look after ſuch things as are New and Extraordinary. But therefore it does not follow that they ſhould always ſtick to them, nor believe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon, that Opinions are True, becauſe they are New; and that thoſe are real Felicities which they have not as yet enjoy'd. Novelty ſhould only induce them to examine new things with care; they muſt not deſpiſe them, becauſe they do not know them; nor raſhly believe that they contain what they wiſh and hope for.</p>
                  <p>But this often comes to paſs: Men after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd the Ancient and Common Opinions, have not diſcover'd the Light of Truth in them: After having had a Taſte of the uſual Felicities of the World, they have not found that Solid Satisfaction in them, which ſhould accompany the Poſſeſſion of a real Good: So that their Deſires and their Eagerneſs are not allay'd by the uſual Opinions and common Felicities. For which reaſon, when they hear any thing that is New and Extraordinary, the Idea of Novelty puts them in hopes at firſt, That it is the thing they are in Search of. And whereas it is Natural to Flatter our ſelves, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60613:222"/>to believe that Things are as we wiſh they might be; their Hopes increaſe proportionably to their Deſires: And in fine, they Inſenſibly change into Imaginary Aſſurances. In the next place, They joyn the Idea of Novelty, and the Idea of Truth, ſo cloſe together, that the one never offers it ſelf without the other; and that which is moſt New, appears to them to be more True, and better than that which is more Uſual and Common; in which they are very different from thoſe, who out of Averſion to Hereſie, have joyn'd the Idea of Novelty to that of Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, imagining that all New Opinions are Falſe and Dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we may ſay that this uſual Diſpoſition of the Mind, and of the Heart of Men, in relation to that which bears the Character of Novelty, is one of the moſt general Cauſes of Errors, for it ſeldom leads them to Truth; whenever it does, it is by Chance and good Luck: And finally, It always directs them from their real Happineſs, by engaging them in that Multiplicity of Divertiſements and Falſe Felicities that the World abounds with: And this is the moſt Dangerous Error into which they can fall.</p>
                  <p>The Third Rule againſt the Exceſſive Deſires of Novelty is,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Third Rule of Curioſity.</hi>
                     </note> That when we are certain that ſome Truths are ſo Myſterious, that it is Morally Impoſſible to diſcover them, and that ſome Felicities are ſo In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable that they can never make us Happy, we ought not to ſuffer our ſelves to be Excited by the Novelty of them.</p>
                  <p>Every body may know by Faith, by Reaſon and Experience, that created <hi>Goods</hi> can never fill the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinite Capacity of the Will. Faith teaches us, That all the Things of this World are only Vanity; and that our Happineſs neither conſiſts in Honours or Riches. Reaſon aſſures us, That ſince it is not in our Power to bound our Deſires, and that we are Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclin'd to Love all Felicities, we can never be Happy, without Poſſeſſing that which Includes them all. Our own Experience makes us Senſible, that we are not Happy in the Poſſeſſion of thoſe Goods which
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60613:222"/>we do enjoy, ſince we ſtill wiſh for more. Finally, We daily ſee that the Great Felicities which the moſt Powerful Princes and Kings enjoy on Earth, are not capable to ſatisfie their Deſires; that they are even more Uneaſie and more Unhappy than others; and that being Seated on the higheſt Spoke of the Wheel of Fortune, they are the more liable to be precipitated and ſhook by its Motion, than thoſe that are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, or nearer to the Center. For they never fall but from on high; their Wounds are always great; and all the Grandeur they are attended with, and which they annex to their own Being, ſerves only to Swell and Aggrandize them, to make them more Senſible of a greater number of Wounds, and expoſe them the more to the Strokes of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>So that Faith, Reaſon and Experience, convincing us that the Delights and Pleaſures of the Earth, which we have not as yet taſted, could not make us Happy though we ſhould enjoy them: We muſt be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, according to that Third Rule, not to ſuffer our ſelves to be Fooliſhly Flatter'd with vain Hopes of Happineſs, which increaſing by degrees proportionably to our Paſſion and to our Deſires, would change at laſt into a Falſe Aſſurance: For when we have a Violent Paſſion for any Good, we always look upon it to be very great, and we perſwade our ſelves Inſenſibly, that the Poſſeſſion of it will make us Happy.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we muſt reſiſt thoſe Vain Deſires, ſince our Endeavours to ſatisfie them would be in vain. But particularly, becauſe that by abandoning our ſelves to our Paſſions, and by employing our time to gratifie them, we loſe God and all things with him. We only wander from one Falſe Felicity to another; We always live in Falſe Hopes; We diſſipate our Spirits, and are agitated a Thouſand different ways; We meet Oppoſitions every where, becauſe the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages we ſeek for are deſired by many, and cannot be poſſeſſed by many. For as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>to Tim.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Thoſe that have a mind to grow Rich, fall into Temptations, and into a Snare of the Devil, and into divers uſeleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60613:223"/>Deſires, which precipitate Men into the Abyſs of Perdition and Damnation; for Covetouſneſs is the Root of all Evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as we ought not to ſeek after the Goods of the World which are new, becauſe we are aſſur'd that we ſhall not find the Happineſs we look for; neither ought we to have the leaſt Deſire of knowing new Opinions upon a great number of difficult Queſtions, becauſe we are inform'd, that the Mind of Man is not capable of diſcovering the Truth of them. Moſt of the Queſtions that are treated of in Morality, and particularly in Natural Philoſophy, are of that kind; and therefore it behoves us to be very diffident of many Books that are daily written upon thoſe Obſcure Intricate Matters. For though abſolutely ſpeaking the Queſtions they contain may be reſolv'd, there are ſtill ſo few Truths diſcover'd, and ſo many others to know, before we can come to thoſe the ſaid Books treat of, that we cannot read them without adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to loſe conſiderably.</p>
                  <p>Yet Men do not regulate themſelves thus, they do quite the contrary: They do not examine whether what is ſaid to them is poſſible: Do but promiſe them extraordinary Things, as the Reparation of Natural Heat, of <hi>Radical Moiſture,</hi> of <hi>Vital Spirits,</hi> or other things they do not underſtand, and you will ſtraight excite their Vain Curioſity. It is ſufficient in order to blind and to gain them to propoſe Paradoxes to them; to uſe obſcure Words, Terms of Influence, and the Authority of ſome unknown Authors; or elſe to perform ſome very ſenſible and extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, although it has no manner of relation to the thing propoſed, for it is enough to Surpriſe them, in order to Convince them.</p>

And when
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60613:223"/>ſome are ſo Indiſcreet as to intimate, that they are not ſatisfied with five or ſix words which really ſignifie and prove nothing; they fancy that thoſe People have not commom Senſe, and that they deny firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And indeed the firſt Principles of thoſe Men, are four or five Scraps of Latin out of ſome Author, or ſome Greek Paſſage, if they are better Scholars.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, It is neceſſary that Learned Phyſicians ſhould ſometimes ſpeak a Language which their Patients do not underſtand, in order to gain ſome Reputation, and to be obey'd.</p>
                  <p>A Phyſician who only underſtands <hi>Latin,</hi> may be eſteem'd in a Village; becauſe <hi>Latin</hi> is both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick</hi> to Peaſants: But unleſs a Phyſician can at leaſt read <hi>Greek,</hi> to learn ſome of <hi>Hypocrates</hi>'s Aphoriſms, he muſt not expect to paſs for a Learned Man in Cities where moſt People underſtand <hi>Latin.</hi> For which reaſon even the moſt Learned Phyſicians knowing this Humour of Men, are oblig'd to ſpeak like Quacks and Illiterate Men; and one muſt not always judge of their Capacity and Senſe, by what they ſay in their Viſits.</p>

                  <p>THe Second Inclination which the Author of Nature imprints continually in our Will,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Second Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or of Self-Love.</hi>
                     </note> is the Love of our ſelves, and of our own Preſervation.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſaid, That God loves all his Works; and that it is only the Love he bears them that preſerves them; and which Wills, That all cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Spirits ſhould have the ſame Inclinations with him. Therefore it is his Will, that they ſhould all
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60613:224"/>have a Natural Inclination for their Preſervation, and that they ſhould Love themſelves. Thus it is lawful and reaſonable to Love our ſelves, ſince we are Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſince God himſelf Loves us, and ſince it is his Pleaſure that we ſhould Love our ſelves: But this is no reaſon that we ſhould Love our ſelves more than God, ſince God is Infinitely more Amiable than we are. It is Unjuſt to place our Final End in our ſelves, and not to Love our ſelves in relation to God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as we have no Goodneſs, nor any Subſiſtance of our ſelves, but only what we participate of the Goodneſs and Being of God, we are not Amiable of our ſelves, but only in relation to him.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, The Inclination we ſhould have for God is loſt by Sin; and all that remains of it is an Infinite Capacity in our Will for all Felicities, or for Good in General, and a ſtrong Inclination to poſſeſs them which can never be deſtroy'd: But the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ought to have for our Preſervation or Self-Love, has increaſed it ſelf to that degree, that it is at laſt become abſolute Maſter of the Will. It has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over chang'd and transform'd into its own Nature the Love of God, or the Inclination which we have for Good in General, and the Love which we ought to have for other Men. For we may ſay now, That we only Love our ſelves, ſince we Love nothing but in relation to our ſelves; whereas we ought only to Love God, and all things in relation to God.</p>
                  <p>If Faith and Reaſon teach us, that God is the only Sovereign Good, and that he alone can make us per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Happy; we may eaſily conclude that we muſt Love him, and we are eaſily enough inclin'd to it: But without Grace it is ſtill Self-Love that Induces us to Love him. Pure Charity is ſo much above our Strength, that we are ſo far from Loving God for himſelf, that Humane Reaſon cannot eaſily conceive, that we can Love him otherwiſe than in relation to our ſelves, and that we have any other Final End but our own Satisfaction. Self-love then is the abſolute Maſter of our Will, ſince the Diſorder of Sin, and the Love of God and of our Neighbour, are now only the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60613:224"/>Conſequences of it; ſince we no longer Love any thing, but becauſe that in Loving it, we expect ſome Advantage, or that we actually receive ſome Pleaſure by it.</p>
                  <p>This Self-love may be divided into two Kinds,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Self-love is divided into the Love of our Being and Well-being, or of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Pleaſure.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> Into the Love of Greatneſs, and into the Love of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; or elſe into the Love of our Being, and of the Perfection of our Being; and into the Love of our Well-being, or of Felicity.</p>
                  <p>By the Love of Greatneſs we affect Power, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, Independency, and that our Being ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of it ſelf. We deſire in ſome reſpect to have a Neceſſary Being: In one Senſe we are deſirous to be like Gods; for none but God has properly a Being which is neceſſarily Exiſtent; ſince that whatever is Dependent exiſts only by the Will of him on whom it depends. Therefore Men wiſhing the Neceſſity of their Being, alſo deſire a Power over others. But by the Love of Pleaſure they deſire not only a Being, but a Well-being; becauſe Pleaſure is a manner of Being, which is beſt and moſt Advantageous to the Soul.</p>
                  <p>We muſt note, that Greatneſs, Excellence and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of the Creature, are not kinds of Being which make us Happy of themſelves; ſince it often happens, that Men become Miſerable in proportion to their growing Great. But as for Pleaſure, it is a kind of Being which we cannot receive actually, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out actually becoming more Happy. Greatneſs and Independence for the moſt part are not in us, and commonly they only conſiſt in the relation we have to thoſe things which are about us. But Pleaſures are in the very Soul, and they are real Modes by which it is modified, and which by their own Nature are capable of ſatisfying it. Therefore we look upon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, Greatneſs and Independence, as things that are proper for the Preſervation of our Being, and even ſometimes as very uſeful, according to the Order of Nature, for the Preſervation of the Well-being: But Pleaſure is always a manner of Being of the Mind, which by it ſelf makes it Happy and ſatisfies it; ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60613:225"/>that Pleaſure is a Well-being, and the Love of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Love of Well-being.</p>
                  <p>Now the Love of Well-being is ſo Powerful, that it ſometimes proves Stronger than the Love of Being; and Self-Love makes us ſometimes deſire not to be, becauſe we have not a Well-being. This is the Caſe of all the Damned, who according to the Word of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> had better not to be, than to be ſo Unhappy as they are; becauſe theſe Wretches being declar'd Enemies to him in whom all Goodneſs Centers, and who is the Sole Cauſe of Pleaſure and of Pain which we are capable of; it is impoſſible they ſhould enjoy any Satisfaction; they are and will be Eternally Unhappy, becauſe their Will will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſame Diſpoſition, and in the ſame Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity. So that Self-Love includes two Loves, the Love of Greatneſs, of Power, of Independence and generality of all things which ſeem to be proper for the Preſervation of our Being; and the Love of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and of all things that are neceſſary for our Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, that is, To be Happy and Satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe two Loves may be divided ſeveral ways: Whether becauſe we are compoſed of two different parts of Soul and Body, according to which they may be divided; or becauſe they may be diſtinguiſh'd or ſpecified by the different Objects that are uſeful for our Preſervation. However we will not inlarge upon that, becauſe, as we do not deſign to make a Treatiſe of Morality, it is not neceſſary to make an Inquiry into, and an exact Diviſion of all the things we look upon as our Felicities. It was only neceſſary to make this Diviſion, to relate the cauſe of our Errors in ſome order.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we ſhall firſt ſpeak of thoſe Errors which are cauſed by our Inclination for Greatneſs, and for all thoſe things that makes our Being Independant of others: And afterwards we ſhall treat of thoſe which proceed from the Inclination we have for Pleaſure, and for all thoſe things which render our Being the beſt it can be for us, or that contents us moſt.</p>

                     </note> or that gives us an Authority over them by making us more Powerful, as Dignities and Riches, ſeem in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to make us Independent. All thoſe that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath us, have a Reſpect for us and fear us; they are always ready to do what pleaſes us for our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and they dare neither Prejudice us, nor op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our Deſires. Therefore Men conſtantly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to poſſeſs thoſe Advantages which raiſe them above others. For they never conſider that both their Being and Well-being in Truth only depend on God above, and not on Men; and that the true Greatneſs which will make them Eternally Happy, does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in that Rank which they hold in the Imagination of other Men, as Weak and as Miſerable as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but in an humble Submiſſion to the Will of God, who being Juſt, will not fail to reward thoſe who remain within the Order he hath preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>But Men do not only deſire Effectively to poſſeſs Learning and Vertue, Dignities and Riches; they alſo uſe their utmoſt Efforts, in order to perſuade others that they do really poſſeſs them. And if it may be ſaid, that they endeavour leſs to appear Rich than to be really ſo; it may alſo be ſaid, that they often take leſs care to be Virtuous, than to appear ſo: For as the Author of the Book Entituled, <hi>Reflectiones Morales,</hi> fays agreeably, <hi>Virtue would not go far, unleſs it were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with Vanity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60613:226"/>
                  <p>The Reputation of being Rich, Learned and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, produces in the Imagination of thoſe that are about us, or that are more nearly related to us, very convenient Diſpoſitions for us: It makes them fall at our Feet; it makes them act in our Favour; it In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with all the Motions that tend to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Being, and to the Increaſe of our Grandeur. Thus Men preſerve their Reputation, as a Good which is neceſſary for them to Live with Eaſe in the World.</p>
                  <p>All Men then have an Inclination for Virtue, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Dignities and Riches, and for the Reputation of poſſeſſing thoſe Advantages. We will now endeavour to ſhow by ſome Examples, how thoſe Inclinations may engage them into Error. Let us begin by the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Men have for Virtue, or for the Appearance of Virtue.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who apply themſelves Seriouſly to become Virtuous, commonly imploy their Mind and Time to underſtand Religion, and to exerciſe themſelves in good Works: They only deſire with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to be acquainted with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Crucified, to find out a Remedy for the Diſtemper and Corruption of their Nature. They deſire no other Knowledge than that which is neceſſary for them to live Chriſtianly, and to know their Duty; after which they apply themſelves to fulfil them with Zeal and Exactneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſeldom trouble themſelves about Sciences, which appear Vain and Barren in reſpect to their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>No Fault can be found with that Conduct, it is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely to be valued;
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Of the falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſome Pious Perſons.</hi>
                     </note> Men would Eſteem themſelves Happy to obſerve it exactly; and they often repent their not having followed it more. But this is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approvable, that ſince it is certain that there are Sciences abſolutely Humane, very Certain and Uſeful, which diſingage the Mind from Senſible Things, and uſe it by degrees to reliſh the Truths of the Goſpel; ſome Pious Perſons, without having examin'd them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them too freely, either as being Uſeleſs, or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:60613:226"/>
                  <p>It is true, that moſt Sciences are very uncertain and very uſeleſs: Men are partly in the right, to believe that they only contain Truths which are of little uſe. No body is oblig'd to ſtudy them; and it is better to deſpiſe them, than to ſuffer ones ſelf to be deceiv'd or blinded by them. Nevertheleſs we may affirm, That it is very neceſſary to know ſome Metaphyſical Truths: The Univerſal Knowledge, or the Exiſtence of a God, is abſolutely neceſſary, ſince even the Certainty of Faith depends on the Knowledge which Reaſon gives of the Exiſtence of a God. It is neceſſary to know, that it is his Will which makes, and which regulates Nature; That the Force or Power of Natural Cauſes is only his Will: In a word, That all things whatever depend on God.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo neceſſary to know what Truth is, the means to diſtinguiſh it from Error, the Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mind and Body, the Conſequences that may be drawn from it, as the Immortality of the Soul, and ſeveral other things of that kind which may be known with certainty.</p>
                  <p>The Knowledge of Man, or of ones ſelf, is a Science that cannot be reaſonably deſpis'd; it contains a World of things which are abſolutely neceſſary to be known to have ſome Juſtneſs and Penetration of Mind: And we may ſay, That if a Stupid Ignorant Man is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely above Matter, becauſe he knows that he is, which Matter does not know; thoſe who know Man, are far above Stupid Ignorant Perſons, by reaſon that they know what they are, which the others do not know.</p>
                  <p>But the Knowledge of Man is not only Valuable, becauſe it raiſes us above others; it is much more ſo, becauſe it humbles us before God. That Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge makes us perfectly Senſible of the Dependence we have on him in all things, and even in our moſt common Actions: It plainly diſcovers the Corruption of our Nature: It diſpoſes us to apply our ſelves to him who alone can cure us; to rely wholly on him, and not to truſt or rely on our ſelves: And thus it gives many Diſpoſitions of Mind, which are
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60613:227"/>very proper to ſubmit our ſelves to the Grace of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>We ought at leaſt to have a Superficial Tincture, and a general Knowledge of the Mathematicks and of Nature. We ought to learn thoſe Sciences in our Youth; they diſingage the Mind from Senſible Things, and hinder it from becoming Weak and Effeminate: They are uſeful enough in Life; they incline us towards God; the Knowledge of Nature does it of it ſelf; and that of the Mathematicks by the Diſguſt it Inſpires in us of the Falſe Impreſſions of our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>Virtuous Perſons muſt not deſpiſe thoſe Sciences, nor look upon them as Uncertain and Uſeleſs, unleſs they are certain that they have ſtudied them enough to judge Solidly of them: There are many others which they may boldly Deſpiſe; Let them Condemn the Poets to the Flames, Heathen Philoſophers, Rabbies, ſome Hiſtorians, and a great Number of Authors, which make the Pride and Knowledge of ſome of the Learned; we ſhall be little troubled at it. But let them not Condemn the Knowledge of Nature, as being contrary to Religion; ſince Nature being regulated by the Will of God, the true Knowledge of Nature teaches us how to admire the Power, Grandeur and Wiſdom of God. For it ſeems that God has form'd the Univerſe in order, that we ſhould Study it, and that by that Study we ſhould learn to Know and to Reſpect the Author of it. So that thoſe who Condemn the Study of Nature, ſeem to oppoſe the Will of God; unleſs they pretend that Sin has rendred Man Incapable of that Study. It is alſo Vain for them to tell us, That the Knowledge of Men only ſerves to make them Proud and Vain, becauſe thoſe who have the Reputation of having a perfect Knowledge of Man, though they often know him Ill, are commonly Intolerably Proud: For it is evident, That no Man can know himſelf well, without being Senſible of his Weakneſs and Miſeries.</p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60613:227"/>
                  <p>Neither are they Perſons of a real and ſolid Piety, that uſually condemn what they do not underſtand;
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Of the falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and Hypocrites.</hi>
                     </note> but rather Superſtitious and Hypocrites. The Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious out of a ſervile Fear, and through a baſeneſs and weakneſs of Mind are ſtartled at the ſight of a lively penetrating Wit. Do but, for Example, give them Natural Reaſons for Thunder, and for its Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and they look upon you ſtrait as an Atheiſt. But the Hypocrites out of a Helliſh Malice, transform themſelves into Angels of Light. They make uſe of the appearances of holy Truths which are reverenc'd by all the World to oppoſe Truths, which are but little known, and little valu'd, out of private Intereſt. They Combat Truth with the Image of Truth; and often in their Hearts, Laugh at what all the World Reſpects; they eſtabliſh in the Opinion of Men, a Reputation, which is ſo much the more ſolid and to be fear'd, as the thing they abuſe is the more Sacred.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe Perſons are the ſtrongeſt, and moſt formidable Enemies of Truth. Indeed, they are pretty rare, but a ſmall number of them is capable of doing a great deal of harm. The appearance of Truth and of Virtue, often does more miſchief, than Truth and Virtue do good; for one cunning Hypocrite is capable to overthrow what ſeveral truly Wiſe and Virtuous Perſons have rais'd with a great deal of Pain and Labour.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> for inſtance, has demonſtrative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prov'd the Exiſtence of a God, the Immortality of our Souls, ſeveral other Metaphyſical Queſtions, a great number of Phyſical Ones; and this Age is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely oblig'd to him for the Truths he has diſcover'd. Yet here ſtarts up an
<note n="*" place="margin">Voetius.</note> inconſiderable Man, a hot and vehement Exclaimer, reſpected by ſome People for the Zeal he expreſſes for their Religion: He Writes Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Books againſt him, and accuſes him of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Crimes. Deſcartes <hi>is a Catholick, he has ſtudied under the Jeſuits; he has often mention'd them with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence.</hi> That is ſufficient for that malicious Man to perſwade People that are Enemies to our Religion,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60613:228"/>and eaſily mov'd in matters ſo Nice as thoſe of Religion, that he is an Emiſſary of the Jeſuits, and has dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Deſigns: Becauſe the leaſt appearances of Truth upon matters of Faith, have more Force upon Peoples Minds, than real and effective Truths of Phyſical or Meraphyſical things have, which are little valu'd. Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has written about the Exiſtence of God. That is matter enough for that Calumniator to exerciſe his falſe Zeal upon, and to oppoſe all the Truths his Enemy defends. He accuſes him of being an Atheiſt, and of teaching Atheiſm cunningly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, like that infamous Atheiſt call'd <hi>Vanino,</hi> who was Burnt at <hi>Thoulouſe;</hi> who Cloak'd his Malice and Impiety by Writing for the Exiſtence of a God; for one of the Reaſons urg'd by him to prove his Enemy an Atheiſt, is, That he did Write againſt Atheiſts, as <hi>Vanino</hi> did, in order to cover his Impiety.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is eaſie for a Man to oppreſs Truth, when he is ſeconded by the appearances of Truth, and has acquir'd a great Aſcendent over weak Minds. Truth delights in Mildneſs, and in Peace; and as ſtrong as it is, it yields ſometimes to the Pride and Haughtineſs of Falſhoods, which Dreſſes and Arms it ſelf with her Appearances. Truth is very ſenſible that Error can never harm it; and if it remains ſometimes as if it were preſcrib'd and in Obſcurity, it is only to wait for more favourable occaſions to ſhow its ſelf; for at laſt it appears, for the moſt part, ſtronger and brighter than ever, in the very place where it is oppreſs'd.</p>
                  <p>I do not wonder that an Enemy of Monſieur <hi>Deſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that a Man of a different Religion from his, that an Ambitious Man, who deſign'd to riſe upon the Ruins of Perſons that are above him, that a Railer without Judgment, that <hi>Voetius</hi> ſhould ſpeak with Contempt of what he neither did, nor could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. But I am ſurpris'd to find, that Perſons who are neither Enemies to Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> nor to his Religion, ſhould entertain Sentiments of Averſion and Contempt againſt him, upon the account of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies they have read in Books written by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his Perſon, and of his Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:60613:228"/>
                  <p>The Book written by that Heretick intitled, <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata cauſa Papatus,</hi> ſufficiently ſhews his Impudence, his Ignorance, and his Paſſion, and his deſire to appear Zealous, in order thereby to acquire ſome Reputation among thoſe of his Party. Therefore he is not a Man to be credited upon his Word. For as there is no reaſon to believe all the Fables he has Collected in that Book againſt our Religion, ſo neither is there any to Credit the Injurious Accuſations he has invented againſt his Enemy.</p>
                  <p>Rational Men will not ſuffer themſelves to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that Monſieur <hi>Deſcartes</hi> is a dangerous Man, becauſe they have read <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>re Word, when they accuſe others of the moſt Enormous Crimes. It is not a ſufficient proof to believe a thing, becauſe we hear it affirm'd by a Man who ſpeaks with Zeal and Gravity. For it is impoſſible for any Perſon to relate Falſities, and Fooliſh Stories, in the ſame manner as he would relate good things, particularly if he has ſuffer'd himſelf to be impos'd upon out of Simplicity and Weakneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie to diſcover the Truth or Falſity of the Accuſations that are form'd againſt <hi>Deſcartes;</hi> his Writings are Extant, and eaſie to be underſtood, by thoſe that are capable of Attention. Therefore I would adviſe People to Read his Works, in order to get better Proofs againſt him than bare Report, and I do not queſtion but after they have read and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd them, they will no longer Accuſe him of Atheiſm; and that on the contrary, they will pay him the Reſpect that is due to a Man, who has plainly and evidently demonſtrated, not only the Exiſtence of a God, and the Immortality of the Soul, but alſo a World of other Truths, which were unknown until his time.</p>

                        <hi>Of the deſire of Science, and of the Judgments of pretenders to Learning.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Mind of Man has without doubt, very little Capacity and Extent, and yet he deſires to know every thing. All Human Sciences cannot ſatifie his Deſires; and yet his Capacity is ſo confin'd, that he cannot perfectly apprehend any one particular Science. He is in a continual Agitation, and deſires always to know; whether he be in hopes of finding what he looks for, as we have ſaid in the preceding Chapter, or whether he perſwades himſelf that his Soul and Mind are extended by the vain poſſeſſion of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Knowledge. The unruly deſire of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Grandeur, makes him ſtudy all manner of Sciences, hoping to find his Felicity in the Science of Morality; and looking for this falſe Greatneſs in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Sciences.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon that ſome Perſons ſpend all their Life in reading of Rabbi's, and other Books Written in Foreign, Obſcure, and Corrupted Languages; and by Authors without Judgment and Knowledge: But that they perſwade themſelves, that when they are skill'd in the Oriental Languages, they are greater and higher than thoſe who are Ignorant of them? And what is it that can encourage them in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful, painful, uſeleſs Labour, unleſs it be the Hope of ſome Preferment, and the Proſpect of ſome new Grandeur? Indeed they are look'd upon as extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Men; they are Complimented upon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Learning; People are better pleas'd to hear them than others: And though it may be ſaid, that they are commonly the leaſt Judicious, if it were only for employing all their Life in a very uſeleſs Study, which can neither make them Wiſer nor Happier: Nevertheleſs, moſt People fancy that they have a great
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60613:229"/>deal more Senſe and Judgment than others: And as they are more Larn'd in the Etymology of Words, they alſo fancy that they are Learn'd in the Nature of Things.</p>
                  <p>The ſame reaſon induces Aſtronomers to ſpend all their Time and Eſtate to get an exact Knowledge of Things; which are not only uſeleſs, but alſo impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know. They endeavour to find an exact Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity in the Courſe of the Planets, which is not in Nature; and to Form Aſtronomical Schemes to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel Effects, of which they do not know the Cauſes. They have made the <hi>Selenography,</hi> or Geography of the Moon, as if People deſign'd to Travel thither: They have already divided it among thoſe that are Famous in Aſtronomy: There are few of them that have not already ſome Province or other in that Country, as a Recompence for their great Labour; and I queſtion whether they are not Proud of having been in Favour with him that has ſo magnificently diſtributed thoſe Kingdoms among them.</p>
                  <p>What is the reaſon that Rational Men apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo much to this Science, and yet remain in groſs Errors, in reſpect to Truths which they ought to know, unleſs they Fancy, thas it is a great thing to know what paſſes in the Heavens? The knowledge of the Vaſt Things that paſſes above, ſeems to them more Noble, Greater, and more worthy of their great Wit, than the knowledge of Vile Abjects, Corruptible Things, as Sublunary Bodies are in their Opinion. The Nobleneſs of a Science is deriv'd from the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of its Objects: It is a great Principle! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knowledge of the Motion of unalterable and incorruptible Bodies, is the higheſt and moſt ſublime of all Sciences. And for that reaſon, it appears to them worthy of the Greatneſs and Excellency of their Mind.</p>
                  <p>Thus Men ſuffer themſelves to be blinded by a falſe Idea of Grandeur, which pleaſes and moves them. As ſoon as their Imagination is ſtruck by it, they fall down before that Phantaſm, they Reverence it; it deſtroys and blinds their Reaſon, which ſhould be the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60613:230"/>Judge of it. Men ſeem to Dream when they Judge of the Objects of their Paſſions, to have no Eyes, and to want Common Senſe. For in fine, where lies the Excellency of the knowledge of the Motions of the Planets; and have we not a ſufficient knowledge of it already, ſince we know how to regulate our Months and our Years? What does it concern us to know, whether <hi>Saturn</hi> is ſurrounded by a Ring, or by a great number of little Moons; and why ſhould we Diſpute about it? Why ſhould any one be proud of having foretold the greatneſs of an Eclipſe; which perhaps he has hit better upon than another, becauſe he has had more Luck? There are perſons appointed by the King's Order to obſerve the Stars, let us rely upon their Obſervations. They may reaſonably apply themſelves to it; for they do it out of Duty: It is their buſineſs. They do it with Succeſs; for they employ all their Time about it with Art, Application, and all the Exactneſs imaginable: They want nothing in order to ſucceed in it. Therefore we ought to be fully ſatisfy'd upon a matter which concerns us ſo little, when they impart their Diſcoveries to us.</p>
                  <p>Anatomy is a very good Study, ſince it is a thing of great uſe, and ſince we ought to delight in the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd Miſeries. But to paſs whole Nights in peeping through a Teleſcope to diſcover ſome Spot, or ſome new Planet in the Heavens, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of our Health, to the impairing our Eſtate, to the neglecting the Care of our Affairs, only to Viſit the Stars Regularly, and to meaſure their Size and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; is in my Opinion, abſolutely to forget what we are at preſent, and what we ſhall be hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Let no Body urge, that it is in order to diſcover the Greatneſs of him that has form'd all theſe great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The leaſt Fly diſcovers more the Power and Wiſdom of God to thoſe that conſider it with Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and without being prejudic'd by its ſmallneſs, than all what the Aſtronomers know of the Heavens.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60613:230"/>Nevertheleſs, Men are not made to conſider Flies, neither do I approve the Pains ſome People have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to inſtruct us how Lice, and all kinds of Animals are Form'd; and how the Transformations of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Worms into Flies, and Butterflies, are effected. It is lawful for Men to amuſe themſelves about theſe things, when they have nothing elſe to do, to divert themſelves: But Men ought not to employ all their time about it, unleſs they are inſenſible of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
                  <p>They ought continually to apply themſelves to the knowledge of God and of themſelves; to labour Seriouſly to overcome their Errors and Prejudices, their Paſſions and Inclinations for Sin; earneſtly to ſearch after the Truths that are moſt neceſſary for them to know. For thoſe are the moſt Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that take moſt Care to diſcover the moſt ſolid Truths.</p>
                  <p>The main Cauſe which engages Men in falſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is, that they have fix'd the Idea of Learning to a Vain, Uſeleſs Knowledge, inſtead of fixing it to ſolid and neceſſary Sciences. For when a Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves upon Learning, and when the Spirit of <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathy</hi> begins to move him; he ſeldom examins what Sciences are moſt neceſſary for him, either to behave himſelf like an Honeſt Man, or to improve his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: He only looks upon thoſe that paſs for Learned Men in the World, and examins what renders them conſiderable. All the moſt ſolid and neceſſary Sciences being pretty Common, the Perſons that poſſeſs them, are neither admired nor reſpected for them; for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things are look'd upon without Attention or Emotion, though never ſo excellent and admirable in themſelves. So that thoſe who aim at Learning, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom fix on thoſe Sciences that are neceſſary for the Conduct of this Life, and for the Perfection of the Mind. Thoſe Sciences do not Excite in them that Idea of Sciences which they have Form'd to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for thoſe are not the Sciences they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd in others, and which they deſire others ſhould admire in them.</p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:60613:231"/>
                  <p>The Goſpel and Morality, are Sciences that are too Common, and too Ordinary; they deſire to learn the Criticiſms of ſome Terms that are met with in Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Philoſophers, or in <hi>Grecian</hi> Poets. Languages, and particularly thoſe that are not in uſe in their Country, as <hi>Arabick,</hi> and that of the <hi>Rabbies,</hi> or the like, appear to them moſt worthy of their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of their Study. If they read the Bible, it is not to learn Religion or Piety: Points of Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, of Geography, and the difficulties of Grammar, take up all their Minds: They deſire the knowledge of thoſe things with more Zeal, than the wholſome Truths of the Goſpel: They are deſirous to poſſeſs that Science themſelves which they have fooliſhly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd in others, and which Fools will not fail to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire in them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame appears in things that relate to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature, they ſeldom Study that which is moſt uſeful in it, but that which is leaſt Common, Anatomy is too mean for them, but Aſtronomy is a more exalted Study. Common Experiments are not worthy their Application; but thoſe extraordinary and ſurpriſing Experiments, which can never Improve us, are what they moſt carefully obſerve.</p>
                  <p>The moſt Obſcure and Ancient Hiſtories are thoſe they are Proud to be acquainted with. They are Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Genealogy of the Princes that Reign at this time; and they make it their buſineſs to ſtudy the Deſcent of thoſe that have been Dead Four Thouſand Years ago. They neglect the moſt Noted Hiſtories of their time, and apply themſelves carefully to the Study of the Fables and Fictions of the Poets. They hardly hnow their own Relations; but if you pleaſe, they will quote you many Authorities to prove, that a <hi>Roman</hi> Citizen was Related to an Emperor, and other like things.</p>
                  <p>They hardly know the Names of the Dreſſes that are worn in their days, and yet loſe their time in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying thoſe of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> The Animals of their own Country are little known by them, and yet they will laviſhly employ whole Years in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60613:231"/>of large Volumes, about the Animals menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the Bible; to ſeem to have gueſs'd better than others what unknown Terms ſigniſie. Such a Book is the delight of its Author, and of the Learned that Read it; for being full of <hi>Greek, Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> Paſſages. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Quotations of Rabbi's, and other obſcure and extraordinary Authors, it ſatisſies the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Author, and the Fooliſh Curioſity of the Readers; who will think themſelves more Learned than others, when they can proudly affirm, that there are Six different Words in Scripture which ſignifie a Lion, or the like.</p>
                  <p>They are often Ignorant of the Map of their own Country, or of the City where they are Born, while they ſtudy the Map of Ancient <hi>Greece,</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> of the <hi>Gauls</hi> in <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi>'s Time, or the Streets and publick Places of Ancient <hi>Rome. Labor Stultorum,</hi> ſays the Wiſe Man, <hi>affliget eos, qui neſciunt in urbem pergere.</hi> They do not know the Way to their own Town, and they Fatigue themſelves Fooliſhly in uſeleſs Diſcoveries. They neither know the Laws, nor Cuſtoms of the Places where they Live; but they carefully Study Ancient Rights, the Laws of the Twelve Tables, the Cuſtoms of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> or of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> or the Ordinances of the Great <hi>Mogol.</hi> Finally, they are deſirous to know all Extraordinary diſtant things, which others do not know, becauſe they have Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhly fix'd the Idea of Learning on thoſe things; and that it is ſufficient to be thought Learned, only to know what others are Ignorant of, though at the ſame time they are Ignorant of the moſt neceſſary and moſt excellent Truths. The Truth is, that the Knowledge of all thoſe things, and the like, is call'd Science, Learning and Doctrin; Uſe will have it ſo: But there is a Science which is only Folly and Vanity ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture; <hi>Doctrina Stultorum fatuitas.</hi> I have not hitherto obſerv'd, that the Holy Ghoſt, which gives ſo many Elogies to Science in holy Writ, ſays any thing to the advantage of that falſe Science, which I have now mention'd.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IF the irregular Deſire of becoming Learned,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Deſire of being thought Learned.</hi>
                     </note> often renders Men more Ignorant, then the Deſire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thought Learned does not only increaſe their Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but it ſeems to turn their Brains: Many Men ſtray from Common Senſe, by endeavouring to ſurpaſs it, and talk at random, being only delighted with Paradoxes. They keep at ſuch a diſtance from Common Thoughts, in order to be thought extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Perſons, that they really ſucceed in it, and that no Body looks upon them without Admiration, or without Contempt.</p>
                  <p>They are look'd upon ſometimes with Admiration; when being preferr'd to ſome Dignity which conceals their Ignorance, they are thought to be as much above others by their Genius and Learning, as they are by their Rank, or by their Birth. But for the moſt part they are look'd upon with Contempt, and ſometimes as Mad Men, when they are more ſtrictly examin'd, and that their Greatneſs does not conceal them from the Eyes of others.</p>
                  <p>The pretenders to Learning evidently diſcover what they are in the Books they Write, and in their uſual Converſations. Perhaps it will be proper to ſay ſomething about it.</p>
                  <p>As it is only Vanity,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Of the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pretenders to Learning</hi>
                     </note> and the deſire of appearing more than others, which ingages them to Study, as ſoon as they are ingag'd in Converſation, the Paſſion and Deſire of Greatneſs awakens them anew, and Tranſports them. They take their Flight ſo high of a ſudden, that we loſe ſight of them; and very often they know not where they are themſelves. They are ſo much afraid of not being above thoſe that hear them, that they are offended if they think they follow
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60613:232"/>others. They are ſtartled as ſoon as any body deſires the leaſt Explanation, and fly into a Paſſion upon the leaſt Oppoſition. In fine, They ſay things that are ſo New, and ſo Extraordinary, but ſo far from common Senſe, that the moſt Prudent have much ado to forbear Laughing, while the reſt are Amaz'd.</p>
                  <p>Their firſt Heat being over, if any Man that has ſo much Conſtancy and Firmneſs of Mind, as not to have been confounded by them, ſhows them that they are miſtaken; they nevertheleſs perſiſt obſtinately in their Errors. The Air of thoſe they have Confounded Confounds them: The Sight of ſo many Approvers, whom they have convinc'd by Impreſſion, Convinces them by a rebound: Or if that Sight does not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, yet it Influences them to that degree, that they ſtill maintain their Falſe Sentiments. Vanity does not allow them to Retract. They always ſeek out ſome Reaſon to defend themſelves: Moreover, they never ſpeak with ſo much Heat and Eagerneſs, as when they have nothing to ſay: They imagine that People deſign to Affront them, and to make them Deſpicable, whenever they urge any Reaſons againſt them; and the more Convincing and Judicious they are, the more they Exaſperate their Pride and Averſion.</p>
                  <p>The beſt way to Vindicate Truth againſt them, is not to Diſpute; ſince it is better both for them and for us, to leave them in their Errors, than to gain their Averſion. We muſt not wound their Heart in order to cure their Mind, ſince the Wounds of the Heart are more Dangerous than thoſe of the Mind: Beſides, It happens ſometimes, that we have to do with Men of true Learning, which we might deſpiſe for want of conceiving their Thoughts. Therefore the beſt way is, to deſire thoſe who ſpeak in a deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive manner, to Explain themſelves as diſtinctly as they can, without allowing them to change the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or to uſe obſcure equivocal Terms; and if they are Perſons of Sence and Learning ſomething will be learn'd by them; but if they are only Pretenders to Learning, they will ſoon Confound themſelves by
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60613:233"/>their own Words, and have no reaſon to blame any body beſides themſelves. Perhaps it may inſtruct us in ſome Reſpects, and may alſo ſerve to divert us, if we may be allow'd to divert our ſelves with the Weakneſs of others, when we endeavour to remedy it. But that which is moſt conſiderable, is, That thereby we may hinder the Weak who hearken'd to them with Admiration, from ſubmitting to Error in following their Deciſions.</p>
                  <p>For it is obſervable, That the Number of Fools, or of thoſe that ſuffer themſelves to be guided like Machines, and by the Impreſſion of the Senſes, being Infinitely greater than that of thoſe who have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Mind, and who are perſwaded by Reaſon: When one of thoſe Learned Men ſpeaks of and decides any thing, there are always a greater Number of thoſe that Believe him upon his Word, than of thoſe that Suſpect him. But whereas thoſe Pretenders to Learning, remove themſelves as far as they can from common Thoughts, both out of a Deſire to meet ſome Oppoſers to Impoſe upon, in order to be cry'd up and to appear Learned, and out of a Spirit of Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; their Deciſions are commonly Falſe and Obſcure, and it is difficult to hearken to them without falling into ſome Error.</p>
                  <p>Now this Method of diſcovering the Errors of others, or the Solidity of their Sentiments, is pretty Difficult to be put in Practice: The Reaſon of it is this, That Pretenders to Learning are not the only Perſons who would ſeem to be Ignorant of nothing, moſt Men have that Defect, particularly thoſe that have ſome Reading, and that have Studied, which is the reaſon that they will always ſpeak and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their Sentiments, without giving a ſufficient Attention to others. The moſt Complaiſant and moſt Reaſonable among them, deſpiſing the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of others in their Hearts, only ſeem to be Attentive, while People may eaſily diſcern in their Eyes, that they do not obſerve what is ſaid, and that their Mind is wholly taken up with what they deſign to prove to us, without thinking of anſwering us.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60613:233"/>This is what often makes Converſations very dull; for as nothing is more Pleaſing, and becauſe the greateſt Honour People can do us, is to conſider our Reaſons, and approve our Opinions, ſo nothing can be more Offenſive, than to ſee that People do not apprehend them; nor ſo much as take the leaſt care that they may do it. For in fine, There is no Pleaſure in ſpeaking to and converſing with Statues; and who are only Statues in relation to us, becauſe they have no value for us, and who have no thoughts to pleaſe us, but only to pleaſe themſelves in endeavouring to ſhow their Parts. But if Men knew how to give a handſom Attention and anſwer well, Converſation would not only be very Agreeable, but alſo very Uſeful; whereas every body ſtriving to be thought Learned, they only hear one another; they act ſometimes Uncharitably, and ſeldom or never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Truth.</p>
                  <p>But the Blunders that are committed by the ſaid Pretenders to Learning in Converſation, are excuſable in ſome Reſpects. It may be urg'd in Favour of them, That Men are but little attentive to what is ſpoken at that time; That the moſt Exact are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times guilty of it; and that they do not deſire their Words ſhould be collected like thoſe of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and of Cardinal <hi>du Perron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is ſome Reaſon in theſe Excuſes, and we are willing to believe, that ſuch kind of Faults deſerve ſome Indulgence. People are deſirous to ſpeak in Converſation, but there are unhappy days in which they do not hit things right. We are not always in a Humour to think and to expreſs our ſelves well; and Time is ſo ſhort on certain Occaſions, that the leaſt Cloud, and the leaſt abſence of Mind, makes thoſe which have the greateſt Intereſt and Penetration of Min, ſtumble unluckily into Extravagant Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.</p>
                  <p>But if the Faults which the Pretenders to Learning commit in Converſation are excuſable, the Faults they are guilty of in their Books, after mature Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, are by no means pardonable, eſpecially if
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60613:234"/>they are frequent, and are not aton'd by ſome good thing. For thoſe who write an ill Book, make abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of People loſe their time in reading of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their falling into the ſame Errors they are guilty of; and this occaſions many more, which is a thing of very ill Conſequence.</p>
                  <p>But though it be a greater Fault than People imagine, to compoſe an ill Book, or only an uſeleſs one, it is a Fault that ſooner meets with Reward than Puniſhment: For there are Crimes which Men do not puniſh, whether it be that they are in Faſhion, or becauſe their Reaſon is not commonly ſo ſteady, to condemn as Criminals, whom they look upon to be Men of better Senſe than they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Authors are commonly look'd upon as Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Men, who ſoar much above others; and ſo they are reſpected inſtead of being puniſh'd. Therefore there is no likelihood that Men ſhould ever erect a Tribunal, to Examine and Condemn all ſuch Books as only ſerve to Corrupt Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>So that we muſt never expect to ſee the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of Letters better regulated than other Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are, ſince both are compos'd by Men. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is very neceſſary, in order to remove Error, to allow the Republick of Letters more Liberty than others, in which Novelty is always very Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous: For ſhould the World Incroach upon the Liberty of Learned Men, and Condemn all Novelties without Diſcernment, it would confirm us in our Errors.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is no reaſon to find fault with my ſpeaking againſt the Government of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of Letters; and with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>my endeavouring to ſhow, that often thoſe great Men which are admir'd by others for their Profound Learning, are at the bottom only Vain Proud Men, without Judgment, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any true Science. I am oblig'd to ſpeak thus of them, leaſt People ſhould blindly ſubmit to their Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and follow their Errors.</p>

                  <p>The Proofs of their Vanity,
<note place="margin">III. <hi>Of the Books of Pretenders to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
                     </note> of their Want of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of their Ignorance, are apparent in their own Works. Thoſe who will give themſelves the Trouble to examine them, with an Intent to Judge of them by the Rule of Common Senſe, and without Prejudice of Eſteem for thoſe Authors, will find that moſt of the Deſigns of their Study are grounded upon an unjudicious Vanity; and that their principal End is, not to perfect their Reaſon, and much leſs to regulate the Motions of their Heart; but only to Confound others, in order to appear more Learned than they.</p>
                  <p>This is the Reaſon, as we have already obſerved, that they always fix upon odd extraordinary Subjects; and that they only uſe odd and extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to explain themſelves; and quote none but odd and extraordinary Authors. They ſeldom explain themſelves in their own Language, it is too common; nor yet with a clear, plain, eaſie <hi>Latin;</hi> they do not ſpeak to be underſtood, but to be admir'd. They ſeldom apply themſelves to Subjects which are uſeful for the Conduct of Life, that ſeems too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them: They neither endeavour to be uſeful to others, nor to themſelves, but only to be thought Learned. They give no Reaſons for what they ſay, or elſe they are ſuch Myſterious and Incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ones, as neither themſelves nor any body elſe conceives with Evidence: They have no clear Reaſons; and if they had they would not uſe them. Thoſe Reaſons do not ſurpriſe the Mind, they look too plain and too common, every body is capable of them. They rather chuſe to relate Authorities to prove, or to ſeem to prove their Thoughts; for often the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities they alledge, prove nothing by the Senſe they contain; they only prove becauſe they are <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Arabick.</hi> But it will not be amiſs to ſpeak of their Quotations, it will in ſome reſpect diſcover the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their Minds.</p>
                  <p>It is very evident, in my Opinion, that nothing but Falſe Learning, and the Spirit of <hi>Polimathy,</hi> could make Quotations ſo much in vogue as they have
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60613:235"/>been hitherto, and as they are ſtill among ſome of the Learned; for it is not very difficult to find Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, who quote large Paſſages every Moment with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reaſon for it; either becauſe the things they advance are ſo clear that no body doubts them; or becauſe they are ſo Obſcure, that the Authority of their Authors cannot prove them: Or laſtly, Becauſe the Quotations they alledge, can add no Ornament to what they ſay.</p>
                  <p>It is repugnant to Common Senſe, to introduce a large <hi>Greek</hi> Paſſage, to prove that the Air is Tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, becauſe it is a thing that is known by every body: To uſe the Authority of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to perſuade us that there are Intelligences which move the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, becauſe it is evident that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could know nothing of it: Or to mix Forteign Languages, <hi>Arabick</hi> and <hi>Perſian</hi> Proverbs in <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Books, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for every bodies uſe; becauſe thoſe Quotations can add no Ornaments to them, or elſe they are Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtical Ornaments, which diſoblige a great many People, and can oblige but very few.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs moſt of thoſe that would be thought Learned, take ſo much delight in thoſe kind of Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that they are not aſham'd ſometimes to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce them in Languages they do not underſtand; and they ſtrain hard to force an <hi>Arabick</hi> Paſſage into their Books, which perhaps they cannot read. Thus they puzzle themſelves to compaſs a thing which is contrary to Common Senſe, yet pleaſes their Vanity, and makes them cry'd up by Fools.</p>
                  <p>They have alſo another Defect which is very conſiderable, and that is, They take little care to ſhow, they have read with Choice and Judgment, they only deſire to appear to have read much, and particularly Obſcure Books, in order to be thought great Scholars; Books that are Scarce and Dear, leaſt People ſhould think they want any thing; Wicked and Impious Books which Honeſt Men dare not read: Juſt like thoſe that brag of Crimes which others dare not commit. Therefore they will rather quote you very Dear, very Scarce, very Ancient, and very
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60613:235"/>Obſcure Books, than ſuch as are more Common and more Intelligible; and Books of Aſtrology, of the <hi>Caballa,</hi> and of Magick, than good Books; as if they were not Senſible, that Reading being the ſame thing as Converſation, they ſhould endeavour to ſhow that they have taken care to read good Books, and ſuch as are moſt Intelligible, and not ſuch as are bad and Obſcure.</p>
                  <p>For as it would argue a Depravation of Mind, to be fond of Converſing commonly with Men we do not underſtand, without an Interpreter, when it is in our Power to inform our ſelves otherwiſe of what we deſire to know: So it is Ridiculous to read only ſuch Books as cannot be underſtood without a Dicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary, when the ſame things may be learn'd in thoſe that are more Intelligible. And as it is a Sign of Madneſs, to affect the Company and Converſation of Impious Perſons; ſo it is the Character of a corrupted Heart, to delight in the reading of ill Books. But it is an Extravagant piece of Pride, to be willing to perſwade, that one has read even thoſe that one has not read, which nevertheleſs is pretty frequent: For there are Perſons that are but Thirty Years of Age, that quote more Ill Books in their Works, than they could have read in ſeveral Ages; and yet they will perſwade others, they have read them with great Exactneſs. But moſt of the Books of certain Learned Men, are only compil'd by dint of Dictionaries, and they have hardly read any thing beyond the Contents of the Books they quote, or ſome Common Places collected out of different Authors.</p>
                  <p>I dare not particularly enlarge upon thoſe things, nor give Examples of them, for fear of offending Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſo Haughty and ſo Splenatick as thoſe Pretenders to Learning are; for there is no Delight in being abus'd in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick.</hi> Moreover, It is not very Material, in order to render what I ſay the more Senſible, to give particular Proofs of it; Men being naturally enough inclin'd to find Fault with the Conduct of others, and to apply what has been ſaid. In the mean time let them pleaſe themſelves with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60613:236"/>that vain Phantaſm of Grandeur; and let them give each other the Applauſes which we refuſe to give them. We have perhaps already diſturb'd them too much in an Injoyment, which ſeems ſo Sweet and ſo Delightful to them.</p>

Let us explain in few words, how theſe Inclinations hinder us from finding out Truth, and engage us into Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Error.</p>
                  <p>We have ſhown in divers Places, that a great deal of Time, Pains, Aſſiduity, and Induſtry of Mind, are required to diſcover Truths that are compos'd and ſurrounded with Difficulties, and which depend on many Principles. From thence it is eaſie to conclude, That Publick Perſons, who have great Imployments, great Eſtates to govern, and great Affairs to manage, and who much Covet Honours and Riches, are not very fit to Search after theſe Truths; and that they often are guilty of Error, in relation to Things that are not eaſily known, when they ſet up for Judges of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe they have but very little Time to imploy in Search of Truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That commonly they do not delight in it.</p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60613:236"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Since they are not very capable of Attention, becauſe the Capacity of their Mind is divided by the multitude of the Idea's of ſuch things as they deſire, and to which they are oblig'd to apply themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe they think they know every thing, and are not eaſily perſwaded that their Inferiours can have a greater ſhare of Reaſon than they have; for though they are willing to learn ſome things of them, they are unwilling to be inſtructed by them in ſolid and neceſſary Truths: They fly out into a Paſſion when any Body contradicts and undeceives them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Since all their Imaginations are commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, though never ſo falſe and oppoſite to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe; and that Men Laugh at thoſe that are not of their Opinion, though they maintain undeniable Truths. The ſordid Flatteries of thoſe that are about them confirm them in their Errors, and in the falſe Eſteem they have of themſelves, and ſo encourages them to judge boldly of all things.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe they ſeldom fix on any but ſenſible No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are fitter for Common Converſations, and to preſerve the Eſteem of Men, than the pure Idea's of the Mind, which ſerve to diſcover Truth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Since thoſe who aſpire to any Dignity, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as much as they can to ſuit themſelves to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of others; becauſe nothing Excites the Envy and Averſion of Men ſo much as too uncommon Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. It is very difficult for thoſe whoſe Mind and Heart is taken up with the Thoughts and Deſires of making their Fortune, to diſcover difficult Truths; and when they do find out any, they often abandon them out of Intereſt, becauſe the Defence of thoſe Truths does not ſuit with their Ambition. Men muſt often Wink at Injuſtice to become Magiſtrates; a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid and uncommon Piety often hinders a Man from obtaining the Goods of Fortune; and the generous Love of Truth often deprives Men of the Pulpit; where Truth ought to be Taught.</p>
                  <p>All theſe Reaſons joyn'd together, make Men that are much above others by their Dignities, Nobility, and Riches, or ſuch who only think of riſing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60613:237"/>their Fortune, very liable to Error, and little ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcovering hidden Truths. For among thoſe things that are neceſſary to avoid Error in Queſtions that are ſomewhat difficult, there are two principal ones that are not commonly met with in the perſons we are ſpeaking of, <hi>viz.</hi> Attention of Mind to Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate into the Bottom of Things; and Wiſdom enough not to Judge of them Raſhly. Even thoſe that are choſen to Teach others, and whoſe Buſineſs it is to Inform themſelves, in order to inſtruct thoſe that are committed to their Care, commonly become liable to Error, as ſoon as they become Publick Perſons: Either becauſe that having very little time, they are incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Attention, and applying themſelves to things which require a great deal of time; or becauſe that being earneſtly deſirous to appear great Scholars, they boldly decide all things without the leaſt Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will hardly ſuffer any Body to Oppoſe, and to Inſtruct them.</p>

                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have ſpoken in the three preceding Chapters of the Inclination we have towards the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Being, and how it occaſions our falling into many Errors: We will now ſpeak of that which we have for Well-being, that is for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and for all things that make us happier and more contented, or that we think capable of doing ſo; and we will endeavour to diſcover the Errors that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from that Inclination.</p>
                  <p>There are Philoſophers who do what they can to perſwade Men, that Pleaſure is not a Good, and that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60613:237"/>Pain is not an Evil: That we may be Happy in the midſt of the moſt violent Pains and Unhappy amidſt the greateſt Pleaſures. As theſe Philoſophers are very Pathetick and Fanciful, they without much difficulty prevail upon the Minds of Weak People, who eaſily receive the Impreſſion which thoſe that ſpeak produce in them: For Stoicks are a little Viſionary, and Viſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries are Vehement; and ſo they eaſily Imprint in others the falſe Sentiments they are poſſeſs'd with. But whereas there is no Conviction againſt Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and our Inward Sentiments, thoſe pompous magnificent Reaſons vaniſh, with all their Luſtre, as ſoon as the Soul is affected with ſome ſenſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or Pain: And thoſe who have plac'd all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in that falſe perſwaſion of their Mind, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd of Wiſdom and Power at the leaſt Attack of Vice; and find that they have been deceiv'd, and that they are vanquiſh'd.</p>
                  <p>Since Philoſophers cannot give their Diſciples the power of overcoming their Paſſions; at leaſt,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>We muſt ſhun Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurethough it make u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> Happy.</hi>
                     </note> they ſhould not ſeduce or perſwade them that they have no Enemies to Encounter. They ſhould ſpeak the Truth; Pleaſure is always a Good, and Pain ever an Evil: But it is not always advantagious to enjoy Pleaſure; for it is ſometimes profitable to ſuffer Pain.</p>
                  <p>But in order the better to Explain my meaning, it is fit to know,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God only is powerful enough to act in us, and to make us ſenſible of Pleaſure and Pain. For it is evident to all Men that conſult their Reaſon, and deſpiſe the Teſtimony of their Senſes, that it is not the Objects which we feel, that Act Effectively in us, and that it is not our Soul neither which cauſes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and pain in it ſelf in reſpect to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Good is commonly to be given, only in order to the performance of ſome good Action, or to reward it; and that commonly Evil is only to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicted in order to prevent an Ill Action, or to puniſh it: And therefore ſince God always acts agreeable to Order, and according to the Rules of Juſtice, all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures either Incline us to ſome good Action, or reward
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60613:238"/>us for it; and all Pains ſerve to prevent ſome ill Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to puniſh us for the Committing of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That there are Actions that are good in one ſenſe, and bad in another. For inſtance, it is an Ill Action to expoſe ones ſelf to Death, when God forbids it. But it is a Good One when God Commands it. For all our Actions are Good or Ill, becauſe God has Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or forbidden them by his firſt general Will, which is the Order and Inſtitution of Nature; or by his other particular Will and Commandments, which are neceſſary for the re-eſtabliſhment of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I ſay that Pleaſure is always Good; but that it is not always advantageous to enjoy it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe that inſtead of engaging us to him who is only capable of cauſing it, it weans us from him to Unite us to that which ſeems falſly to cauſe it. It ſets us at a Diſtance from God, to Unite us to a Vile Creature. For although true Philoſophers ſometimes think that Pleaſure is not occaſion'd by outward Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and that that may in ſome meaſure Incline them to Acknowledge and Love God in all things; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſince the Introduction of Sin, the Reaſon of Man is ſo Weak, and his Senſes and Imagination have ſo much Power over his Mind, that they ſoon Corrupt his Heart. When we do not lay aſide, according to the Advice of the Goſpel, all things that do not of themſelves incline us to God. For the beſt Philoſophy cannot Cure the Mind, nor reſiſt the diſorder of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since Pleaſure is a Reward, it is a piece of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice to produce Motions in our Body which oblige God, in conſequence of his firſt Will, to make us feel Pleaſure, when we do not deſerve any; either becauſe the Action we do is Uſeleſs or Criminal, or becauſe that being full of Sin, we ought not to deſire a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of him. Man before the Fall might juſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſenſible Pleaſures in his Regular Actions: But ſince the Fall there are no ſenſible Pleaſures altogether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, nor any but ſuch as are capable of injuring us when we enjoy them; for often the bare taſting of them is ſufficient to make us Slaves to them.</p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:60613:238"/>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe God being Juſt, he muſt needs at ſome time or other puniſh the Violence that is offer'd to him, when Men oblige him to recompence with Pleaſure the Criminal Actions which they Commit againſt him. When our Soul ſhall be no longer united to our Bodies, God will no longer lye under the Obligation which he has laid upon himſelf, to give us Senſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to anſwer to the Motions of the Mind; and he will ſtill remain under the Obligation of ſatisfying his Juſtice: And therefore that will be the time of his Vengeance and Wrath. Then without changing the Order of Nature, and remaining always Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his firſt Will, he will puniſh the unjuſt pleaſures of the Voluptuous, with Pains that never will have an End.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe that the certainty we have in this Life that the ſaid Juſtice muſt be perform'd, agitates the Mind with mortal Diſquiets, and flings it into a kind of Deſpair, which renders the Voluptuous miſerable, even in the midſt of the greateſt Pleaſures.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Since commonly diſmal Remorſes accompany the moſt Innocent Pleaſures, becauſe we are convinc'd that we deſerve none; and thoſe Remorſes deprive us of a certain Inward Joy, which is found even in actions of Penitence.</p>
                  <p>Thus though Pleaſure is a Good, it muſt be granted that it is not always advantageous to enjoy it for theſe Reaſons; and for others like theſe, which it is very neceſſary to know, and which are eaſily deduced from theſe; and it is always very advantageous to ſuffer Pain, though it be really an Evil.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, all Pleaſure is a Good, and actually makes thoſe Happy that enjoy it, while they enjoy it, and as long as they enjoy it; and all Grief or Pain is an Evil, and actually makes the perſon that ſuffers it unhappy, while he ſuffers it, and as long as he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it. It may be ſaid that the Righteous and Holy are the moſt unhappy Men in this Life, and the moſt worthy of Compaſſion. <hi>Si in vita tantum in Chriſto ſperamus, miſerabiliores ſumus omnibus hominibus,</hi> ſays Saint <hi>Paul;</hi> for thoſe that Weep, and ſuffer
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60613:239"/>Perſecution for Juſtice, are not Happy becauſe they ſuffer Perſecution for Juſtice; but becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is theirs, and a great Reward is in ſtore for them in Heaven; that is, Becauſe they ſhall be Happy. Thoſe that ſuffer Perſecution for Juſtice are thereby Juſt, Virtuous, and Perfect, becauſe they are in the Order that God has preſcrib'd, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection conſiſts in following him: but they are not Happy becauſe they Suffer. A time will come when they will Suffer no more; and then they will be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, as well as Juſt and Perfect.</p>
                  <p>However, I do not deny but that the Righteous may be Happy in ſome meaſure even in this Life, by the ſtrength of their Hope and Faith, which render thoſe future Felicities, as it were, preſent to their Mind. For it is certain, that when the Hope of ſome Happineſs is ſtrong and lively, it draws it nearer to the Mind, and gives it a taſte thereof before-hand: And thus it makes us Happy in ſome meaſure, ſince it is the taſte and poſſeſſion of Good and of Pleaſure, which makes us Happy.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is unreaſonable to tell Men that ſenſible Pleaſures are not Good, and that thoſe that enjoy them are never the Happier; ſince it is not true, and at the time of Temptation they diſcover it to their misfortune. We muſt tell them, that thoſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are good in themſelves, and capable to make them Happy in ſome meaſure: Nevertheleſs, they ought to avoid them for the Reaſons beforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned; but they cannot avoid them of themſelves: Becauſe they deſire to be Happy through an Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they cannot overcome, and thoſe tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory Pleaſures which they ought to avoid, ſatisfie it in ſome meaſure: Thus they are in a miſerable Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of loſing themſelves, unleſs they are aſſiſted. It is neceſſary to tell them theſe things, that they may diſtinctly know their Weakneſs, and the want they have of a Redeemer.</p>
                  <p>We muſt ſpeak to Men like <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and not like the Stoicks, who neither underſtand the Nature nor Diſtemper of Human Minds. They muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60613:239"/>be told, that they muſt hate and deſpiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not look for an Eſtabliſhment or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on Earth: That they muſt daily carry their Croſs, or the Inſtrument of their ſuffering, and that they muſt loſe their Life at preſent, in order to preſerve it Eternally. They muſt be taught, that they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to act contrary to their deſire, to make 'em ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their inability to good. For Men wou'd be invincibly Happy, and they cannot be actually ſo, unleſs they do what they pleaſe. Perhaps being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of their preſent Evils, and knowing their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſufferings, they may humble themſelves on Earth: Perhaps they may invoke the Aſſiſtance of Heaven, and ſeek a Mediatour; be afraid of ſenſible Objects, and timely abhor whatever flatters their Senſes and Concupiſcence. And it may be they may thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Spirit of Prayer and Repentance which is ſo neceſſary to obtain Grace, and without which there is no Power, no Health, nor no Salvation to be expected.</p>
                  <p>We are inwardly convinc'd that Pleaſure is Good,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>It muſt not incline us to the Love of ſenſible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</hi>
                     </note> and that the inward Conviction thereof is not Falſe, for Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is really Good. We are Naturally Convinc'd, that Pleaſure is the Character of Good, and that Natural Conviction is certainly true; for that which Cauſes Pleaſure is certainly very Good, and very Lovely. But we are not convinc'd, that either ſenſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or our Souls themſelves, are capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Pleaſure in us; for there is no reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, and there are a Thouſand againſt it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſenſible Objects are neither Good, nor Lovely. Were they neceſſary toward the Preſervation of Life, we ought to uſe them: But as they are not capable of Acting in us, we ought not to Love them. The Soul muſt only Love him that is Good, who only is capable to make it Happier, and more perfect. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould only Love that which is above it, ſince it can receive its Perfection from nothing that is either below, or equal to it.</p>
                  <p>But whereas we judge that a Thing is the Cauſe of ſome Effect, when it always attends it, we fancy
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60613:240"/>that they are Senſible Objects which act in us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at their approach we have new Senſations, and becauſe we do not ſee him that produces them really in us. We taſte a Fruit, and we find a Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; we impute that Sweetneſs to that Fruit; we conclude that it cauſes it, and even that it contains it. We do not ſee God as we ſee and as we feel that Fruit; we do not ſo much as think on him, nor perhaps on our ſelves: Therefore we do not conclude that God is the real Cauſe of that Sweetneſs, nor that the ſaid Sweetneſs is a Modification of our Soul; we impute both the Cauſe and the Effect, to that Fruit which we eat.</p>
                  <p>What I have ſaid of Senſations which have a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Body, is alſo to be underſtood of thoſe that have no relation to it, as thoſe which are found in pure Intelligences.</p>
                  <p>The Mind conſiders it ſelf; it ſees that nothing is wanting to its Happineſs and Perfection; or elſe it ſees that it does not poſſeſs what it deſires. At the ſight of its Happineſs it feels Joy; at the ſight of its Misfortunes it endures Sorrow. It ſtraight fancies, that it is the ſight of its Happineſs which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in it ſelf that Sentiment of Joy, becauſe the ſaid Sentiment always attends that ſight. It alſo imagines, that it is the ſight of its Misfortune which produces in it ſelf that Sentiment of Grief, ſince the ſaid Sentiment is the Conſequence of this ſight. The real Cauſe of thoſe Sentiments, which is God alone, does not appear before it: It does not ſo much as think on God; for he acts in us without our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
                  <p>God rewards us with a Sentiment of Joy, when we know that we are in the Condition in which we ought to be, that we may remain in it, that our Diſquiet may ceaſe, and that we may fully enjoy our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without ſuffering the Capacity of our Mind to be filled with any thing elſe. But he produces a Sentiment of Grief in us, when we are Senſible that we are not in the State in which we ought to be, ſo that we may not remain in it, and that we might
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60613:240"/>earneſtly ſeek after the Perfection that is wanting in us. For God puſhes us continually toward Good, when we are Senſible that we do not poſſeſs it; and he fixes us powerfully upon it, when we find that we poſſeſs it fully. So that it ſeems evident to me, that the Intellectual Sentiments of Joy or of Grief, as well as the Senſible ones, are no voluntary Productions of the Mind.</p>
                  <p>Therefore we ought continually to acknowledge by our Reaſon, that Inviſible Hand which fills us with Bliſs, and which diſguiſes it ſelf to our Mind, under Senſible Appearances. We muſt Adore it, we muſt Love it; but we muſt alſo Fear it, for ſince it fills us with Pleaſures, it may alſo overwhelm us with Grief. We ought to Love it by a Love of Choice, by a Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Love, by a Love worthy of God, when we Love him becauſe we know that he is Amiable: And that Love is worthy of us, becauſe that being Reaſonable, we ought to Love that which Reaſon informs us to be worthy of our Love. But we Love Senſible Things, by a Love that is unworthy of us, and which they are alſo unworthy of: For being Reaſonable, we Love them without any Reaſon to Love them, ſince we do not clearly know that they are Lovely; and on the contrary, we know they are not ſo. But Pleaſures Seduce us, and make us Love them; the Blind and Irregular Love of Pleaſure, being the real Cauſe of thoſe Falſe Judgments of Men in Subjects of Morality.</p>

                     <hi>THE Inclination</hi> we have for Senſible Pleaſures being diſorder'd, is not only the Source of the Dangerous Errors we fall into in caſes of Morality,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60613:241"/>and the general Cauſes of the Depravation of our Manners; it is alſo one of the Principal Cauſes of the Diſorder of our Reaſon, and it engages us Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly into very groſs Errors, but leſs dangerous upon Subjects that are meerly Speculative; becauſe the ſaid Inclination hinders us from having a ſufficient Attention for things that do not affect us, to apprehend them, and to judge well of them.</p>
                  <p>We have already ſpoken in ſeveral places, of the Difficulty Men find in applying themſelves to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are a little uncommon, becauſe the Matter we treated of then requir'd it. We ſpoke of it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the firſt Book, in ſhowing that the Senſible Idea's affecting the Soul more than the Pure Idea's of the Mind, it often applied it ſelf more to the Manner than the Thing it ſelf. We ſpoke of it in the Second, becauſe in treating of the Delicacy of the Fibers of the Brain, we ſhow'd whence the Softneſs of certain Effeminate Minds did proceed. Finally, We ſpoke of it in the Third, in mentioning of the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Mind, when we were about proving, that our Soul had but little Attention to Things that were meerly Speculative; but a great deal more to ſuch as affect it, and make it Senſible of Pleaſure or Grief.</p>
                  <p>Our Errors have commonly ſeveral Cauſes which contribute all to their Riſe: So that we muſt not imagine, that it is for want of Order that we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times repeat almoſt the ſame things, and that we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute ſeveral Cauſes to the ſame Errors; it is becauſe there are really many. I ſpeak ſtill of occaſional Cauſes; for we have often declar'd, that there are no other Real and True, but the ill uſe of our Liberty, which we do not always make uſe of ſo much as we might, as we have explain'd at the beginning of this Work.</p>
                  <p>No body ought to blame us, if in order to make Men plainly conceive, how for Example the Senſible Manner in which things are cover'd, does Surpriſe and makes us liable to fall into Error; we have been oblig'd to ſay before-hand in the other Books, that we
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60613:241"/>had an Inclination for Pleaſures, which ſeems neceſſary to be repeated in this, which treats of Natural Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and the ſame of ſome other things in other places. All the Harm it will occaſion is, that there will be no neceſſity to ſay many things here, which we ſhould have been oblig'd to explain, if it had not been done elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>All things that are in Man, are ſo dependant on one another, that we find our ſelves often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd, under the number of things we are to treat of at one and the ſame time, to explain perfectly what we conceive. We are ſometimes neceſſitated not to divide things that are joyn'd by Nature one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to proceed contrary to the order we had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, when that order occaſions nothing but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, as it happens of neceſſity on ſome occaſions. Yet for all this it is impoſſible to give others an Idea of all we think of: All that we can commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, is to put others in a way to diſcover with Pleaſure and Eaſe, what we have diſcover'd with great Labour and Pains. And whereas it is Impoſſible to diſcover any thing without Attention, we muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſtudy the Means to make others Attentive. 'Tis what we have endeavour'd to do, though we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge we have perform'd it weakly, and we own our Faults the more willingly, to the end that the ſaid Confeſſion may excite thoſe who ſhall read this, to render themſelves Attentive of their own accord, in order to remedy the ſame, and to penetrate to the bottom of theſe Subjects, which without doubt deſerve to be well conſider'd.</p>
                  <p>The Errors, into which the Inclination we have for Pleaſure, and generally for all things that affect us, engage us, are Infinite; becauſe the ſaid Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion diſſipates the Sight of the Mind, and it applies it continually on the confus'd Idea's of the Senſes, and the Imagination; and it inclines us to judge of all things raſhly, by the bare relation they have to us.

                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We never ſee Truth, until we ſee things as they are; and we never ſee them as they are, unleſs we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60613:242"/>ſee them in him that contains them after an Intelligible manner. When we ſee things our ſelves, we only ſee them very Imperfectly, or rather we only ſee our own Sentiments, and not the Things we are deſirous to ſee, and which we falſely imagine we do ſee.</p>
                  <p>It requires a great deal of Application to ſee things as they are in themſelves; becauſe it is now impoſſible for Man to unite himſelf to God without Pain and Labour: To ſee things in our ſelves, requires no Application on our part, ſince we feel what touches us even againſt our Will. Naturally we find no anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating Pleaſure in the Union we have with God, the pure Idea's of things do not move us. Therefore the Inclination we have for Pleaſure, does neither apply nor unite us to God; on the contrary, it weans and removes us from him: For that Inclination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces us continually to conſider things by their Senſible Idea's, becauſe thoſe Falſe and Impure Idea's affect us. The Love of Pleaſure, and the actual Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pleaſure, which revives and increaſes our Love for it, removes us continually from Truth, to caſt us into Error.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thoſe that are deſirous to draw near to Truth, to be guided by its Light, muſt begin by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide Pleaſure: They muſt carefully avoid what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever affects and agreeably divides the Mind; for the Senſes and Paſſions muſt be ſilenc'd, in order to hear the Word of Truth; it being neceſſary to withdraw our Affections from the World, and to condemn all Senſible Things, as well for the Perfection of the Mind, as for the Converſion of the Heart. When our Pleaſures are great, when our Sentiments are lively, we are not capable of the plaineſt Truths, and we do not ſo much as grant common Notions, unleſs they contain ſomething that is Senſible. When our Pleaſures, or other Senſations are moderate, we can diſcover ſome plain eaſie Truths: But if it were poſſible for us wholly to lay aſide Pleaſures and Senſations, we ſhould be capable of diſcovering with eaſe the moſt conceal'd Truths, and the moſt difficult
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60613:242"/>that are known: For the more we remove from that which is not God, the nearer we draw to God himſelf, we avoid Error, and we diſcover Truth. But ſince the Fall, ſince the unruly Love of anticipating Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, which rules predominantly, the Mind is become ſo weak, that it can penetrate into nothing, and ſo Material and Dependant on the Senſes, that it cannot reach difficult things which do not affect it. It does not even perceive common Notions, and often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes for want of Attention, that they are Falſe and Obſcure. It cannot diſtinguiſh the Truth of things from their Uſefulneſs, the relation they have among one another, from the relation they have to us; and it often believes that thoſe are the Trueſt that are the moſt Uſeful, the moſt Agreeable, and that affect it moſt. In fine, That Inclination Infects and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds all the Perceptions we have of Objects, and conſequently all the Judgments we make of them. Here are ſome Examples.</p>
                  <p>It is a common Notion that Virtue is preferable to Vice; that it is better to be Chaſte,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>Some Examples.</hi>
                     </note> than Intemperate and Voluptuous. But our Inclination for Pleaſure, confounds that Idea to that degree on ſome occaſions, that we have but a glimpſe of it left; and it is impoſſible to draw the Conſequences from thence, which are neceſſary for the Conduct of Life. The Soul is ſo taken up with the Pleaſures it hopes for, that it ſuppoſes them Innocent, and aims at nothing but the Means to enjoy them.</p>
                  <p>Every body knows, that it is better to be Juſt than Rich: That Juſtice exalts a Man more than the Poſſeſſion of the moſt Sumptuous Buildings, which often ſerve leſs to diſcover the Grandeur of the Owner, than the Greatneſs of his Injuſtices and Crimes. But the Pleaſure which Inadvertent People receive in the Vain Oſtentation of their Falſe Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, ſufficiently fills up the ſmall Capacity of their Mind, to conceal and obſcure ſo evident a Truth from them. They fooliſhly imagine that they are great Men, becauſe they have great Houſes.</p>

                     <hi>Specious Algebra</hi> is certainly the fineſt, I mean the moſt Fruitful and moſt Certain of all Sciences; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it the Mind has neither Penetration nor Extent; and with it, it is capable of knowing almoſt every thing that can be known with Certainty and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. As Imperfect as that Science has been, it has made all thoſe Famous that have learn'd it, and that have known how to Practice it: They have thereby diſcover'd Truths which ſeem'd almoſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible to other Men. It is ſo well propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to Humane Minds, that without diſtracting their Capacity with uſeleſs things in what they ſeek after, it conducts them Infallibly to what they aim at. In a word, It is an Univerſal Science, and as it were the Key of all other Sciences; yet as valuable as it is in it ſelf, it has nothing in it that is taking in order to Charm Men, by this reaſon only, that it is not Senſible. It has been buried abſolutely in Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ſeveral Ages. There are at this very time, many Men who do not know the name of it; and among a Thouſand Perſons, you will hardly meet one or two who underſtand any thing in it: The moſt Learned that have reviv'd it in our days, have not carried it very far, and have not handled it with that Order and Clearneſs it deſerves. Being Men as well as others, they have at laſt been diſguſted with thoſe pure Truths which are not attended by Senſible Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and the Diſquietneſs of their Will being Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by Sin, the Inconſtancy of their Mind, which depends on the Agitation and Circulation of the Blood, has not allow'd them to conſider any longer thoſe Great, thoſe Vaſt, and thoſe Plentiful Truths, which are the Immutable and Univerſal Rules, of all Tranſitory and particular Truths, that may be known with Exactneſs.</p>

                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:60613:243"/>one may, or ought to affirm a thing is, by what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the clear and diſtinct Idea one has of it: That <hi>Nothing</hi> has no Proprieties; That a thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be reduc'd to nothing without Miracle; That no body can move it ſelf by its own Force; That an Active Body can communicate no more Motion to any Body it encounters, than it has of it ſelf, and the like. They have never conſider'd thoſe Axioms with Stedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Clearneſs enough, to diſcover the Truth of them diſtinctly; and they have ſometimes made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, which have falſely convinc'd them, that ſome of thoſe Axioms were not true. They have ſeen on ſome occaſions, that two Viſible Bodies meeting each other, ceas'd both to move after the Blow: They have ſeen in others, that the Bodies which were hit, had more Motion than the Viſible Bodies that did hit them: And this Senſible Sight of ſome Experiments, whoſe reaſons they ſee not, makes them decide things againſt certain Principles, which paſs for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Notions in the Minds of all thoſe that are capable of any Attention. Ought they not to conſider, that Motions may be communicated from Viſible Bodies to Inviſible ones, when the Bodies that are in motion meet; or from the Inviſible to the Viſible on other occaſions? When a Body is Suſpended by a Cord, the Knife wherewith that Cord is cut, does not give the Motion to that Body, it is an Inviſible Matter that does it. When a Coal of Fire is flung into a heap of Gun-powder, it is not the motion of the Coal, but an inviſible Matter, which ſcatters all the parts of that Powder, and which gives it a motion capable of blowing up a Houſe. There are a Thouſand ways by which inviſible Matter communicates its Motion to groſs viſible Bodies: At leaſt it is not evident that it cannot be done, as it is evident that the moving force of Bodies can neither be increas'd nor diminiſh'd by the uſual force of Nature.</p>
                  <p>So Men ſee that the Wood that is ſlung into the Fire, ceaſes to be what it is; and that all the Senſible Qualities they obſerve in it diſſipate themſelves; and from thence they think they are in the right, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60613:244"/>that it is poſſible for a thing to return to its former nothing: They do no longer ſee the Wood, and they only ſee a few Aſhes which ſucceed it; and from thence they judge that the major part of the Wood ceaſes to be, as if the Wood could not be redu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> that the force which gives a being to all things, is not ſubject to change; and that by the ordinary force of Nature, what is, cannot be reduced to nothing, as what is not, cannot begin to be. But few Men know what it is to look within themſelves, there to hear the Voice of Truth, according to which they ought to judge of all things; their Eyes regulate their Deciſions: They judge according to what they feel, and not according to what they conceive, for they feel with Pleaſure, and conceive with Pain.</p>
                  <p>Ask all Men in the World, Whether one may affirm, without fear of being deceiv'd, that the whole is greater than a part, and I am confident that there is not one, but will anſwer immediately as he ought to do. Ask them in the next place, Whether we may likewiſe, without fear of being deceiv'd, affirm of a thing, that which we conceive clearly to be included within the Idea which repreſents it; and you will find, that few will grant it without Heſitation, that more will deny it, and that the major part of them will not know what to anſwer. Yet this Metaphyſical Axiom, That we may affirm of a thing, which we conceive clearly to be included in the Idea which repreſents it, is more evident than this Axiom, That the whole is greater than its part; becauſe this laſt Axiom is not an Axiom, but only a Concluſion in reſpect to the firſt. One may prove that the whole is greater than part by this firſt Axiom; but this firſt can be proved by no other: It is abſolutely the firſt, and the Foundation of all clear and evident Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Why then does no body heſitate upon the Concluſion, and yet many queſtion the Principle from which it is deriv'd; unleſs it be becauſe the Idea's of the whole and of part are Senſible; and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60613:244"/>that our Eyes inform us, that the whole is larger than part of it; and that our Eyes do not ſee the Truth of the firſt Axiom of all Sciences?</p>
                  <p>As there is nothing in this Axiom, that naturally fixes or applies the Mind, we muſt be willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it conſtantly and willingly, in order to make an evident Diſcovery of the Truth thereof. But Men ſeldom think on Objects which do not affect their Senſes; and when they do, it has no Prevalency with them.</p>
                  <p>For to continue our ſaid Example, they think it evident, that the whole is greater than its part; that a Mountain of Marble is poſſible, and that a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain without a Vale is impoſſible; and that it is not equally evident that there is a God. Nevertheleſs we may ſay, that the Evidence is equal in all thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, ſince they are all equally diſtant from the firſt Principle.</p>
                  <p>This is the firſt Principle: We muſt attribute that to a thing which we conceive clearly to be included in the Idea which repreſents it: We clearly conceive that there is more Extent in the Idea we have of the whole, than in the Idea we have of its part: That a poſſible Exiſtence is contain'd in the Idea of a Mountain of Marble, the Impoſſible Exiſtence in the Idea of a Mountain without a Vale; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Exiſtence in the Idea we have of God, I mean, of an Infinitely perfect Being. Therefore the whole is larger than part of it: Therefore a Mountain of Marble may be Exiſtent: Therefore a Mountain without a Vale cannot be Exiſtent: Therefore God or an Infinitely Perfect Being does neceſſarily Exiſt. It is viſible that theſe Concluſions are equally diſtant from the firſt Principle of all Sciences: They are then equally evident in themſelves: It is then as evident that God does Exiſt, as that the whole is greater than its part. But whereas the Idea's of Infinite, of Perfections, of neceſſary Exiſtence, are not Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, like the Idea's of the whole and of its part, Men fancy they do not perceive what they are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of; and though theſe Concluſions are equally
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60613:245"/>Evident in themſelves, they are not however equally receiv'd.</p>
                  <p>There are Men who endeavour to perſwade us, that they have no Idea of an infinitely perfect Being. But I do not know what induces them to anſwer poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they are ask'd whether an infinitely perfect Being is Round or Square, or ſomething like it: For they ought to anſwer, that they know nothing of it, if it be true that they have no Idea of it.</p>
                  <p>There are others who grant, that thoſe Reaſon well who conclude, that God is not an Impoſſible Being, from this, that we ſee the Idea of God includes no Contradiction, or an impoſſible Exiſtence; and they will not allow us to conclude in the ſame manner, that God Exiſts neceſſarily, from this that we conceive a neceſſary Exiſtence in the Idea we have of him.</p>
                  <p>Finally, There are others who pretend that this proof of the Exiſtence of God is a Sophiſm; and that the Argument only concludes, ſuppoſing it is true that God Exiſts, as if it were not prov'd. This is our proof: <hi>We ought to attribute that to a thing which we conceive clearly to be included in the Idea which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it.</hi> This is the general Principle of all Sciences. Neceſſary Exiſtence is included in the Idea which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents a Being infinitely Perfect; they grant it. And Conſequently we muſt ſay, that the infinitely perfect Being Exiſts. Yes, ſay they, ſuppoſing that he Exiſts.</p>
                  <p>But let us make ſuch an Anſwer to ſuch an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to the End that the World may Judge of the Solidity of their Anſwer. Here is an Argument like it. We ought to attribute that to a thing which we conceive clearly to be included in the Idea which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it: That is the Principle. We clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive four Angles included in the Idea which repreſents a Square, or we conceive clearly that poſſible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence is included in the Idea of a Marble Tower: Therefore a Square has Four Angles: Therefore a Marble Tower is poſſible. I ſay thoſe Concluſions are true, ſuppoſing that the Square has Four Angles; juſt as they anſwer that God Exiſts, ſuppoſing he does
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60613:245"/>Exiſt: That is to ſay in a word, The Concluſions of thoſe Demonſtrations are true, ſuppoſing they are true.</p>
                  <p>I own, that if I ſhould make ſuch an Argument as this, we muſt attribute that to a thing which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive clearly to be included in the Idea which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it, for we clearly conceive the neceſſary Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance included in the Idea of a Body infinitely Perfect, conſequently a Body infinitely Perfect Exiſts. It is true, I ſay, that ſhould I make ſuch an Argument, People would be in the right to anſwer, that it would not conclude the Actual Exiſtence of a Body infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Perfect; but only ſuppoſing that there were ſuch a Body, it would have its Exiſtence in it ſelf. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, that the Idea of a Body infinitely Perfect is a Fiction of the Mind, or a Compounded Idea; which conſequently may be Falſe or Contradictory, as indeed it is: For we cannot clearly conceive a Body infinitely Perfect; ſince a particular Finite Being, as a Body is, cannot be conceiv'd to be Univerſal and Infinite.</p>
                  <p>But the Idea of God, or of a general Being, of an unlimited Being, of an infinite Being, is not a Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mind. It is not a Compounded Idea which includes any Contradiction; nothing can be plainer, though it Comprehends all that is, and whatever may be. Now that plain and natural Idea of Being or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity, includes a neceſſary Exiſtence; for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that Being (I do not ſay <hi>ſuch a Being</hi>) has Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence in it ſelf; and that Being cannot actually not be Being, ſince it is impoſſible and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Real Being ſhould be without an Exiſtence. It may chance that Bodies may not be, becauſe Bodies are <hi>ſuch Beings</hi> as participate of Being, and depend on it. But unlimited Being is neceſſary; it is Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; it derives what it is from it ſelf. All that is proceeds from it. If there is any thing, it is, ſince all proceeds from it: But though there were nothing in particular, it would be; becauſe it is of it ſelf, and we cannot conceive it clearly as not Being, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we look upon it as Being in particular, or like
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60613:246"/>
                     <hi>ſuch a Being;</hi> and that we thus conſider all other Idea's beſides that of Being. For thoſe that do not ſee that God is, commonly do not conſider Being, but <hi>ſuch a Being;</hi> and conſequently a Being that may be, and may not be.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, that we may yet more diſtinctly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend this proof of the Exiſtence of God, and anſwer ſome Objections that might be made, more clearly, we muſt remember that when we ſee a Creature, we do not ſee it in it ſelf, nor by it ſelf; for we only ſee it, as it has been prov'd in the Third Book, by the ſight of ſome Perfections that are in God, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it. Thus we may ſee the Eſſence of that Creature, without ſeeing its Exiſtence; we may ſee in God that which repreſents it, without its Exiſting. Therefore neceſſary Exiſtence is not included in the Idea which repreſents it, it not being neceſſary that it ſhould be, to the End it may be ſeen. But the Caſe is very different in the inſinitely perfect Being; It can only be ſeen in it ſelf; for nothing that is Finite can repreſent Infinity So that we cannot ſee God, unleſs he Exiſts: It is impoſſible to ſee the Eſſence of a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely Perfect, without ſeeing the Exiſtence of it: We cannot ſee it barely as a poſſible Being: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Comprehends it; and if we think on it, it muſt be.</p>
                  <p>But it is uſeleſs to propoſe theſe kind of Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the common ſort of Mankind. Theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations may be call'd Perſonal, by reaſon that they do not generally convince all Men. We muſt uſe more ſenſible ones in order to Convince them; and indeed they are not wanting: For no Truth has more Proofs than that of the Exiſtence of God. This was only urg'd to ſhew, that refin'd Truths making hardly any Impreſſions on our Senſes, are taken for Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Chimera's; whereas, when groſs palpable Truths affect the Senſes, forcing the Soul to conſider them, we are eaſily perſwaded that they have a great deal of reality; for ſince the Fall they make ſtrong Impreſſions on our Mind.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:60613:246"/>
                  <p>'Tis for the ſame reaſon, that there is no proſpect to hope, that the common part of Mankind will ever ſubmit to this Demonſtration to prove, that Animals are not ſenſible, <hi>viz.</hi> that being Innocent, which all the World grants, and I ſuppoſe it, if they were capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Senſation, it would happen that under a God infinitely Juſt and Almighty, an Innocent ſhould ſuffer Grief, which is a pain, and the puniſhment of Sin. Men are commonly incapable of ſeeing the Evidence of this Axiom, <hi>Sub juſto Deo, quiſquam niſi mereatur, miſer eſſe non poteſt;</hi> which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes uſe of with a great deal of Reaſon againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> to prove Original Sin, and the Corruption of our Nature. They Fancy that there is neither Force nor Solidity in this Axiom, and in ſome others which prove, that Beaſts are not ſenſible, becauſe as we have already ſaid, thoſe Axioms are refin'd, and include nothing that is ſenſible or palpable, or make any Impreſſion upon our Senſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſenſible Actions and Motions of Beaſts, towards the preſervation of that Life, are Reaſons, which though only probable, affect us more; and which conſequently, incline us much more powerfully to believe that they are ſenſible of Pain or Grief, when they cry out being ſtruck <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60613:247"/>as they always ſenſibly ſee in what manner they ſeek for thoſe things that are neceſſary for their preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore they are not inclin'd to believe that there are Souls in Eggs, by ſome ſenſible Impreſſion of neceſſary Motions to Transform Eggs into Chickens; but they allow Animals Souls, by reaſon of the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Impreſſion of the External Actions of thoſe Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals for preſervation of their Life; although the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I have here alledg'd, is ſtronger to give Souls to Eggs than to Chickens.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Reaſon, which is, that Matter is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of feeling, and of deſiring, is certainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative againſt thoſe who ſay, that Animals are ſenſible, notwithſtanding their Soul is Corporeal. But Men will Eternally Confound and Intangle thoſe Reaſons, rather than own a thing contrary to Proofs that are not only probable, but very ſenſible and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And there is no way to convince them abſolutely, but in oppoſing ſenſible proofs to their ſenſible proofs; and in ſhewing them viſibly, that all the parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals are only Machinal; and that they may move without a Soul by the meer Impreſſion of Objects, and by their peculiar Conſtitution; as Monſieur <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> has begun to do it in his Treatiſe of Man. For all the moſt certain and evident reaſons of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alone will never perſwade them the contrary of the obſcure Proofs they have by the Senſes: And we only expoſe our ſelves to the Laughter of Perſons of a ſuperficial Underſtanding, that are not capable of much Attention, when we undertake to convince them by Reaſons above the common Level, that Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals have no Feeling.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it behoves us well to remember, that the Violent Inclinations we have for Divertiſements, Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and generally, for all that does affect us, throws us into a great number of Errors: Becauſe the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of our Mind being Bounded, that Inclination withdraws our Mind continually from the Attention we ſhould give to the clear and diſtinct Idea's of the Underſtanding, which are proper to diſcover Truth, to apply it to the falſe, obſcure, and deceitful Idea's
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60613:247"/>of our Senſes; which Influence the Will more by the hope of Good and Pleaſure, than they Inſtruct the Mind by their Light and Evidence.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>IF it happens often that the little Pleaſures and ſlight Pains which we actually feel, nay more, which we have a Proſpect of, ſtrangely diſturb our Imagination, and hinder us from judging of things according to their true Idea's; we have no reaſon to believe that the proſpect of Eternity cannot act upon our Mind. But it will be neceſſary to conſider what it may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing there.</p>
                  <p>We muſt obſerve in the Firſt Place, that the hopes of an Eternity of Pleaſures does not Act ſo powerfully upon the Mind, as the fear of an Eternity of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The Reaſon of it is, Men do not Love Pleaſure ſo much, as they Hate Pain. Moreover, by the Internal Knowledge they have of their Diſorders, they are ſenſible that they deſerve Hell; and they ſee nothing in themſelves to Merit ſuch great Rewards, as to participate of the Felicity of God himſelf. They are ſenſible when they pleaſe, and even ſometimes againſt their Will, that far from deſerving Rewards, they are worthy of the greateſt Chaſtiſements; for their Conſcience never leaves them; but they are in the like manner continually convinc'd, that God is willing to ſhew his Mercy upon Sinners, after having ſatisfy'd his Juſtice upon his Son. Therefore the Juſt themſelves have more Lively Apprehenſions of the Eternity of Torments, than Hopes of an Eternity of Pleaſures. The proſpect of Pain then conſequently, is more prevailing than the proſpect of Reward; and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60613:248"/>here is partly that which it is capable of producing, not alone, but as a principal Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>It produces an infinite number of Scruples in the Mind, and confirms them ſo much, that it is almoſt impoſſible to get rid of them. It Extends, as it were, even Faith to prejudices, and makes us pay the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is only due to God, to Imaginary Powers. It obſtinately fixes the Mind on vain or dangerous Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions. It makes Men earneſtly and zealouſly Embrace Human Traditions, and Practices that are uſeleſs for Salvation, Judaick and Phariſaick Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have been invented by ſervile Fear. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it ſometimes throws Men into a blindneſs of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair: Inſomuch, that looking confuſedly on Death as an Annihilation, they fooliſhly haſten to make away with themſelves, to be freed of the Mortal Diſquiets which poſſeſs and frighten them.</p>
                  <p>There is often more Charity than Self-Love, in the Scrupulous, as well as in the Superſtitious; but there is nothing but Self-love in the deſperate: For taking the thing rightly, thoſe muſt needs Love themſelves extreamly, who chuſe rather not to be, than to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie. Women, Young People, and Weak Minds are the moſt ſubject to Scruples and Superſtitions, and Men are more liable to Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie to know the reaſon of theſe things. For it is Viſible, that the Idea of Eternity being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the moſt terrible, and the moſt frightful of all thoſe that ſurpriſe the Mind, and ſtrike the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is neceſſary it ſhould be attended with a long Train of Acceſſory Idea's, to make together a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Effect upon the Mind, becauſe of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have to that great and terrible Idea of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>Whatever has any relation to Infinity cannot be Little, or if it is Little in itſelf, it receives an immenſe greatneſs by that Relation, which cannot be compar'd to any thing that is Finite. Therefore whatever has any relation, or even what we fancy to have any relation, either to an unavoidable Eternity of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or Delights which is propos'd to us, muſt needs
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60613:248"/>frighten thoſe Minds that are capable of any Reflection or Thought.</p>
                  <p>The Fibers of the Brains of Women, or young People, and of weak Minds, being, as I have ſaid elſewhere, Soft and Flexible, receive deep Marks of one of theſe two: And when they have abundance of Spirits, and are more capable of Thought and Juſt Reflection, they receive by the Vivacity of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination a very great number of falſe Impreſſions and Acceſſary Idea's, which have no Natural Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Principal Idea. Nevertheleſs that Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though Imaginary, maintains and fortifies thoſe Falſe Impreſſions, and Acceſſary Idea's which it has created.</p>
                  <p>When two Lawyers are ingag'd in ſome great Cauſe, which wholly takes up their Mind, and yet do not underſtand the Caſe, they often have vain Fears, being in dread that certain things may Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice them which the Judges have no regard to, and which experienced Lawyers do not fear. The Affair being of very great Conſequence to them, the Motion it produces in their Brains diffuſes it ſelf, and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to diſtant traces which have naturally no relation to it. It fares juſt in the ſame manner with the Scrupulous, they unreaſonably form to themſelves Subjects of Fear and Diſquiet; and inſtead of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Will of God in the Holy Scriptures, and of relying on thoſe whoſe Imagination is not tainted; their Mind is wholly taken up with an Imaginary Law, which diſorderly Motions of Fear impreſs on their Brains. And though they are inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd of their Weakneſs, and that God does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from them certain Duties which they preſcribe to themſelves, ſince they hinder them from ſerving him; they cannot forbear preferring their Imagination to their Underſtanding, and from ſubmitting rather to certain Confuſed Sentiments which frighten and plunge them into Error, than to the Evidence of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which gives them Aſſurance, and leads them again into the right way to Heaven.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:60613:249"/>
                  <p>We meet often with a great deal of Charity and Virtue in Perſons that are afflicted with Scruples; but there is not near ſo much in thoſe that are addicted to ſome Superſtitions, and who imploy themſelves chiefly about ſome Judaick or Phariſaick Practices. God will be ador'd in Spirit and in Truth; He is not ſatisfied with Geſtures and External Civilities, as kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Preſence, and being Praiſed by the Motion of the Lips, when the Heart has no ſhare in it. Men indeed are ſatisfied with thoſe Marks of Reſpect, but 'tis becauſe they cannot ſearch into the Heart; for even Men would be ſerv'd in Spirit and in Truth. God requires our Mind and our Heart; he has only made it for himſelf, and he only preſerves it for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But there are many People, who unfortunately for themſelves refuſe him thoſe things, over which he has abſolute Right. They harbour Idols in their Hearts, which they adore in Spirit and in Truth, and to whom they Sacrifice themſelves. But whereas the True God threatens them in the Secret of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, with an Eternity of Torments to puniſh the Exceſs of their Ingratitude; yet they will not quit their Idolatry; they bethink themſelves of performing ſome good Works externally: They Faſt like others, they give Alms, they ſay Prayers, they continue for ſome time in the like Exerciſes; and whereas they are troubleſom to thoſe that want Charity, they leave them commonly to imbrace certain little Practices or eaſie Devotions, which agreeing with Self-Love, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and inſenſibly overthrows all the Morals of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They are Faithful, Earneſt and Zealous Defenders of thoſe Humane Traditions, which Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Perſons perſwade them to be very Uſeful, and ſuch things as the Idea of Eternity that frightens them, does continually repreſent, they eagerly defend, as abſolutely neceſſary for their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſo with the Juſt: They hear the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of their God, as well as the Impious; but the confuſed Noiſe of their Paſſions, does not hinder them from hearkning to his Counſels. The falſe Rays of Humane Tradition do not blind them ſo far, as to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60613:249"/>make them Inſenſible of the Light of Truth. They put their Confidence in the Promiſes of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and they follow his Councils; for they know that the Promiſes of Men are as Vain as their Counſels. Nevertheleſs we may ſay, That that Fear which the Idea of Eternity creates in their Mind, produces ſometimes ſo great a Diſorder in their Imagination, that they dare not abſolutely Condemn thoſe Humane Traditions; and that ſometimes they approve them by their Example, becauſe they have <hi>ſome Appearance of Wiſdom in their Superſtition, and in their Falſe Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> like thoſe Phariſaical Traditions mentioned by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But that which is particularly worthy of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which does not ſo much relate to the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Manners, as to the Diſorder of the Mind, is, That the Fear we have before mentioned, extends to the Faith, as well as the Zeal, of thoſe that are affected with it; even to Things that are Falſe, and Unworthy the Holineſs of our Religion. There are many People who do believe, and that with an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Faith, That the Earth is Immovable in the Center of the World: That Animals are Senſible of real Pain: That there are Forms or Accidents really diſtinct from Matter: And a World of the like Falſe or Uncertain Opinions, becauſe they fancy that they ſhould oppoſe the Faith in denying it. They are frighten'd by the Expreſſions of the Holy Bible, which ſpeaks to our Capacity, and conſequently makes uſe of the common Manner of Speaking, without any Deſign to Inſtruct us in Natural Philoſophy. They do not only believe what the Spirit of God will teach them, but alſo all the Opinions of the Jews. They do not ſee, for Example, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpeaks before his Soldiers, as <hi>Copernicus</hi> himſelf, <hi>Galileus</hi> and <hi>Deſcartes</hi> would ſpeak to the Vulgar part of Mankind; and that though he had been of the Opinion of theſe laſt Philoſophers, he would not have commanded the Earth to ſtand ſtill, becauſe he could not have made his Army Senſible, by unintelligible words, of the Miracle which God perform'd for his People. Thoſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60613:250"/>who are of Opinion that the Sun is Immovable, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs tell their Servants, their Friends, and even thoſe that are of their Opinion, that the Sun Riſes or Sets: They always ſpeak like other Men, when their Principal Deſign is not to Philoſophiſe. Did <hi>Joſhua</hi> perfectly underſtand Aſtronomy; or if he did, did his Souldiers underſtand it? Or if both he and his Souldiers were skill'd in it, can any body think that they deſign'd to Philoſophiſe while they only thought of Fighting? Therefore <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſpoke as he ought to do, although both he and his Souldiers had believ'd what the moſt Eminent Aſtronomers believe at this time. Nevertheleſs thoſe words of that great Captain, <hi>Sun, ſtand thou ſtill upon Gibeon;</hi> and what is ſaid afterwards, that the Sun ſtood ſtill according to his Command, perſwade many People, that the Opinion of the Motion of the Earth, is not only a dangerous Opinion, but that it is alſo abſolutely Heretical, and not to be maintain'd. They have heard that ſome Pious Perſons, for whom we ought to have a great deal of Reſpect and Deference, condemn'd that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. They have a confuſed Knowledge of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that happen'd upon that Subject to a Famous Aſtronomer of our Age, and that ſeems ſufficient for them to believe Obſtinately, that Faith extends even to that Opinion. A certain confus'd Sentiment, excited and entertain'd by a Motion of Fear, which they hardly perceive, makes them harbour Diffidences againſt thoſe that follow Reaſon in things which relate to Reaſon. They look upon them as Hereticks: They are Uneaſie and Troubled whenever they hear them ſpeak; and their Secret Apprehenſions create in their Minds the ſame Reſpect, and the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for their own vulgar Opinions, and for many other Notions of Philoſophy, as for Truths which are the Objects of Faith.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>OF all our Inclinations taken in General, and in the Senſe I have explain'd it in the firſt Chapter, there only remains that which we have for thoſe we Live with, and for all the Objects that are about us; of which I ſhall hardly ſay any thing, becauſe that relates more to Morality and Policy, than to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. As that Inclination is always joyn'd with the Paſſions, it would perhaps be ſitter to ſpeak of it in the following Book: But Order is not of ſo much Conſequence in that Point.</p>
                  <p>In order rightly to apprehend the Cauſes and Effects of that Natural Inclination,
<note place="margin">I. <hi>Of the Third Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, which is the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip we have for other Men.</hi>
                     </note> it is fit to know that God Loves all his Works, and that he Unites them ſtrictly one to another for their Mutual Preſervation. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually loving the Works he produces, ſince they are produc'd by his Love, he alſo continually Imprints in our Hearts a Love for his Works, ſince he continually produces a Love in our Hearts like unto his. And to the end the Natural Love we have for our ſelves may not Annihilate it ſelf, and overmuch weaken that which we have for the Things that are not in us: And on the contrary, That thoſe two Loves which God puts in us, may maintain and ſtrengthen each other, he has united us in ſuch a manner to all things that are about us, and particularly with the Beings of the ſame Species with us, that their Sufferings Afflict us Naturally, their Joy Rejoyces us, and their Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur, their Fall, their Diminution, ſeems to Augment or to diminiſh our own Being. The new Dignities of our Relations and Friends, the new Acquiſitions of thoſe that have moſt relation to us, the Conqueſts and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60613:251"/>Victories of our Prince, and even the new Diſcoveries of the new World, ſeem to add ſomething to our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Being united to all theſe things, we rejoyce at their Grandeur and Extenſion; we could even wiſh that this World had no Limits; and that thought of ſome Philoſophers, that the Works of God have no Bounds, does not only ſeem worthy of God, but alſo very agreeable to Man, who feels a Secret Joy at his being a part of Infinity, becauſe as little as he is in himſelf, he fancies that he becomes as it were Infinite, by defuſing himſelf into the Infinite Beings that are about him.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the Union which we have with all the Bodies that move in thoſe great Spaces, is not very ſtrict, and therefore it is not Senſible to moſt Men: And there are ſome who matter the new Diſcoveries that are made in the Heavens ſo little, that one might believe they are no-wiſe united to it by Nature; if it were not known that it is either for want of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or becauſe they are too much engag'd to other things.</p>
                  <p>The Soul, though united to the Body it Animates, does not always feel the Motions of it; or if it does, it does not always apply it ſelf to them. The Paſſion which moves it, being ſometimes greater than the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations which affects it, it ſeems to be more powerfully engag'd to the Object of its Paſſion than to its own Body: For it is principally by the Paſſions that the Soul defuſes it ſelf upon External Objects, that it feels it is really united to every thing about it; as it is chiefly by Senſation that it defuſes it ſelf in its own Body, and is Senſible that it is united to all the Parts that Compoſe it. But whereas one cannot conclude that the Soul of a Paſſionate Perſon is not united to his Body, becauſe he is prodigal of his Life, and takes no Care for the Preſervation of it: So there is no reaſon to imagine, that we are not naturally engag'd to all things, becauſe there are ſome for which we are not concern'd.</p>
                  <p>Would you for Example know, whether Men are united to their Prince, or their Country? Seek out
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60613:251"/>ſome who underſtand their Intereſt, and have no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Affairs to take up their Mind: Then you will ſee how Earneſt they are for News, their Diſquiet for Battles, their Joy for Victories, their Affliction in Defeats: There you will clearly ſee, that Men are ſtrictly united to their Prince and their Country.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, Would you know whether Men are united to <hi>China, Japan,</hi> or the Planets and fix'd Stars? Seek out ſome, or elſe imagine ſome, whoſe Country and Family enjoy a profound Peace, that have no particular Paſſions, and that do not actually feel the Union that unites them to things that are nearer us than the Heavens; and you will find, that if they have any Knowledge of the Greatneſs and Nature of thoſe Stars, they will rejoyce at the Diſcovery of any of them; they will conſider them with Pleaſure; and if they are Ingenious, they will willingly take the Trouble to obſerve and Calculate their Motions.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are buſied with Aſſairs, ſeldom mind whether any Comet appears, or whether there is an Eclipſe: But thoſe who are not ſo cloſely united to the things that are near them, are very fond of theſe ſort of Events; becauſe there is nothing to which we are not united, though we do not always feel it; as we do not always feel that our Soul is united, I do not ſay to our Arm, or to our Hand, but to our Heart, and to our Brain.</p>
                  <p>The ſtrongeſt Natural Union which God has put between us and his Works, is that which united us with thoſe Men we live with: God has commanded us to Love them like our ſelves; and that the Love of Choice, by which we love them, may be Firm and Conſtant, he upholds and ſtrengthens it continually, by a Natural Love which he imprints in us. In order thereunto he has laid upon us ſome Inviſible Tyes which neceſſarily oblige us to Love them; to watch their Preſervation like our own; to look upon them as neceſſary parts to the whole which we compoſe with them, and without which we cannot Subſiſt.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more Admirable than thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Relations which are found betwixt the Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60613:252"/>of the Minds of Men, between the Motions of their Bodies, and between theſe Inclinations and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. All this Secret Chain is a Wonder which can never be ſufficiently admir'd, and which can never be apprehended: At the ſight of any Pain which Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes, or that is felt, for example, we cry out; that Cry which often comes out before we are aware of it, by the Diſpoſition of the Machine, Infallibly ſtrikes the Ears of thoſe that are near enough to afford us the Aſſiſtance we ſtand in need of: It penetrates through them, and makes it ſelf underſtood to People of all Nations, and of all Qualities whatever; for that Cry is of all Languages and of all Qualities, as indeed it ought to be: It moves the Brain, and in a Moment changes the whole Diſpoſition of the Body of thoſe that are ſtruck by it: Morcover, it makes them run to aſſiſt before they are aware of it: But it is not long without acting upon the Mind, and without obliging them to be willing to relieve them, and of thinking of Means to ſecure thoſe that have made that Natural Prayer; provided always the ſaid Prayer, or rather this preſſing Command be Juſt and according to the Rules of Society: For an Indiſcreet Cry, made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cauſe, or out of a vain Fear, produces Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Scorn in the Aſſiſtants, inſtead of Compaſſion, becauſe in crying without a cauſe, we abuſe things eſtabliſh'd by Nature for our Preſervation. That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcreet Cry naturally produces Averſion, and the Deſire of revenging the Abuſe that has been offer'd to Nature, I mean to the Order of things, provided he that made it, did it voluntarily: But it ought only to produce the Paſſion of Laughter, mix'd with ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, without Averſion and a Deſire of Revenge; when it proceeds from Fear, that is, from a falſe Appearance of a preſſing Neceſſity, which has induced any one to cry out: For Laughter or Jeſt is neceſſary to repel their Fear, and to correct them; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is neceſſary to Succor them as Weak: It is impoſſible to conceive any thing better order'd.</p>
                  <p>I do not pretend to explain by Example, which are the Springs, and the Relations which the Author of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60613:252"/>Nature has placed in the Brains of Men and all Animals, to maintain the Conſent and Union which is neceſſary for their Preſervation. I only make ſome Reflections upon thoſe Springs that People may think upon them, and may carefully inquire, not how thoſe Springs move, nor how their Motion is communicated by the Air, by the Light, and by all the little Bodies that ſurround us, for that is almoſt Incomprehenſible and is not neceſſary, but at leaſt to know what are the Effects of it: One may by different Obſervations, diſcover the Bonds that unite us one to another, but it is impoſſible to know how that is done: We eaſily ſee how a Watch points out the Hour; but it requires time to diſcover the Reaſons of it; and there are ſo many different Springs in the Brain of the leaſt Animal, that nothing can equal it in the moſt ſtudied Machines.</p>
                  <p>If it is not poſſible perfectly to apprehend the Springs of our Machine, neither is it abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; but it is abſolutely neceſſary in order to govern our ſelves, to know the Effects which thoſe Springs are capable of producing in us. It is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know how a Watch is made to uſe it; but if Men will uſe it, to regulate their time, it is at leaſt neceſſary to know that it points at the hours. Nevertheleſs there are ſome ſo little capable of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that one might almoſt compare them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animated Machines; they do not feel in themſelves the Springs which ſlacken at the ſight of Objects; they are often agitated without perceiving their own Motions; they are Slaves without feeling their Bonds: Finally, They are guided a Thouſand different ways, without knowing the Hand of him that guides them: They think themſelves the only Authors of all their Motions; and not diſtinguiſhing what paſſes within them, as a Conſequence of a Free Act of their Will, from that which is produced there by the Impreſſion of the Bodies which are about them, they think they guide themſelves while they are guided by ſome other. But this is not a proper place to explain theſe things.</p>

                  <p>The Relations which the Author of Nature has put between our Natural Inclinations, in order to Unite us together, ſeems yet more worthy of our Application and Enquiries, than thoſe that are between Bodies, or between Minds in relation to Bodies. For all things are regulated there in ſuch a manner, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations which ſeem to be moſt oppoſite to Society, are the moſt uſeful, when they are ſomewhat moderated.</p>
                  <p>The deſire, for Inſtance, which all Men have for Grandeur, tends to the Diſſolution of all Societies. Nevertheleſs, that deſire is temper'd in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by the Order of Nature, that it ſerves more for the good of the Publick, than many other feeble Languiſhing Inclinations. For it gives Emulation, it Excites Men to Vertue, it Buoyes up their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage in the Services they do their Country; and ſo many Victories would not be won, did not Soldiers, and particularly Officers aſpire to Glory, and to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. Thus all thoſe who Compoſe Armies, deſigning only their own Intereſt, do notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing procure the Good of their Country. Which ſhews, that it is very advantageous for the Publick Good, that all Men ſhould have a ſecret deſire of Grandeur, provided it be moderated.</p>
                  <p>But ſhould all private Perſons appear to be what they really are; ſhould they freely tell others that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be the principal Parts or Members of the Body they Compoſe, and never to be the leaſt, it would not be the way to Unite them together. All the Members of a Body cannot be the Head and Heart of it: There muſt be Feet and Hands, little ones as well as great ones, Men to Obey as well as to Command; and ſhould every Body ſay openly, that they will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and never Obey, as indeed every Body wiſhes Naturally, it is viſible that all Bodies Politick would deſtroy themſelves, and Diſorder and Injuſtice would Reign every where.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it was neceſſary, that thoſe who have moſt Senſe, and are the fitteſt to become the Noble Parts of that Body, and to Command the reſt, ſhould be Naturally Civil; that is, they ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60613:253"/>by a ſecret Inclination, to ſhew others by their Behaviour, and Affable and Gentile Expreſſions, that they think themſelves unworthy of being thought on, and that they believe they are the leaſt of Men: But that thoſe they ſpeak to are worthy of all ſorts of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and that they have a great Eſteem and Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for them. In fine, to ſupply the defect of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the Love of Order, it has been neceſſary that thoſe who Command others, ſhould have the Art of deceiving 'em by an Imaginary Humiliation, which only conſiſts in Civilities and Words, in order to enjoy that preheminence without Envy which is neceſſary in the whole Body. For thus all Men do in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure poſſeſs the Grandeur they deſire: The great ones poſſeſs it in reality,
<note n="*" place="margin">I ſpeak as a Man; for the true Grandeur of the Earth does not conſiſt in a turn of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> and the little ones, and the weak only poſſeſs it in Imagination; being perſwaded in ſome meaſure by the Compliments of others, that they are not look'd upon as they are, that is, as the leaſt of Men.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſie to conclude by the by, from what we have ſaid, That it is a great Breach of Civility to ſpeak often of ones ſelf, eſpecially, advantageouſly, though one did poſſeſs all ſorts of good Qualifications; ſince it is not allowable to ſpeak to thoſe we Converſe with as if we were above them, unleſs it be on certain oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and when there are External and Senſible Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which Elevate us above them. For Contempt is the greateſt of all Injuries: It is that which is moſt capable of deſtroying Society; and we muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that a Man to whom we have given a hint, that we look upon him to be below us, will ever join with us, becauſe Men cannot endure to be thought the meaneſt part of the Body they Compoſe.</p>
                  <p>The Inclination of Men for Compliments, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore very proper to Counterpoiſe that which they have for Eſteem and Preferment, and to ſoften the Internal Pain which thoſe feel that are the meaneſt parts of the Body Politick; and it is moſt certain, that the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe two Inclinations does produce very good Effects to maintain Society.</p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:60613:254"/>
                  <p>But there is a ſtrange Corruption in thoſe Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as well as in the Friendſhip, Compaſſion and Good Will of the others, which tend to Unite Men together. That which ought to maintain Civil Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, often cauſes the Communication and Eſtabliſhment of Error.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Inclinations that are neceſſary for Civil Society,
<note place="margin">II. <hi>That In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination induces us to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the thoughts of our Friends, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them by falſe Praiſes.</hi>
                     </note> thoſe which throw us moſt into Error are Friendſhip, Favour, Gratitude, and all the other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations which induce us to ſpeak too advantageouſly of others when they are preſent.</p>
                  <p>We do not limit our Love to the Perſons of our Friends, but we alſo Love whatever does any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them: And as they commonly expreſs ſome Paſſion in the Defence of their Opinions, they inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly incline us to believe them, to approve them, and even to defend them with more Obſtinacy and Paſſion than they do themſelves: Becauſe it would often look ill in them to maintain their own Opinions with Heat; But no Body can find fault with us if we defend them, In them it would be Self-Love, in us 'tis Generoſity.</p>
                  <p>We have an Affection for other Men upon ſeveral accounts; for they may pleaſe and ſerve us in ſeveral ways. The reſemblance of Humours, of Inclinations, of Imployments; their Air, their Behaviour, their Virtue, their Eſtate, the Affection or Eſteem they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for us, the Services they have done us, or that we expect from them, and ſeveral other particular reaſons, do determin us to Love them. Therefore when any of our Friends, I mean ſome Perſon that has the ſame Inclinations that appears well, that ſpeaks agreeably, whom we think Virtuous, or of great Quality, who expreſſes an Affection and Eſteem for us, that has done us ſome Service, or from whom we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any; or finally, whom we Love for ſome other particular reaſon: If any ſuch Perſon, I ſay, chances to advance ſome Propoſition, we ſuffer our ſelves ſtrait to be perſwaded by them, without conſulting our Reaſon. We maintain his Opinion without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining whether it be Conſonant to Truth, and often
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60613:254"/>even contrary to our own Conſcience, according to the Obſcurity and Confuſion of our Mind, according to the Corruption of our Heart, and according to the advantage we expect to derive from our falſe Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity.</p>
                  <p>It is not neceſſary to bring particular Examples of thoſe things in this place; for People are ſeldom an hour in any Company without obſerving ſeveral, if they will reflect a little upon them. Favours and Laughters, according to the old ſaying, do but ſeldom ſide with Truth; but almoſt always with thoſe they Love. He that ſpeaks is Obliging and Civil: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is in the right. If what he ſays is barely like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is look'd upon as True; and if what he urges, is abſolutely ridiculous and impertinent, it will at leaſt become very probable. If it is a Man that Loves me, who has an Eſteem for me, who has done me ſome Service, and is deſirous and capable of doing me more, who has maintain'd my Opinion on other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, I ſhould be ungrateſul and imprudent in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his, or even in failing to applaud him. Thus Truth is abus'd, and is made ſubſervient to Intereſt; and thus we embrace each others falſe Opinions.</p>
                  <p>An honeſt Man can never be offended when any one that inſtructs and informs him, provided it be done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Civility: And when our Friends take Offence at our repreſenting modeſtly to them, that they are deceiv'd, we muſt allow them to Love themſelves and their Errors; ſince they will have it ſo, and becauſe we have not the Power to Command them, nor to change their Mind.</p>
                  <p>But a real Friend muſt never approve the Errors of his Friend. For we ought to conſider, that we do them more harm than we are aware of, when we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciouſly defend their Opinions. Our Applauſes ſwell their Hearts, and confirm their Errors; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Incorrigible; they Act and Decide as if they were become Infallible.</p>
                  <p>Whence comes it that the Richeſt, the moſt Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, the Nobleſt, and generally all thoſe that are Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60613:255"/>above others, think themſelves very often In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; and behave themſelves as if they had a great deal more Reaſon than thoſe that are of a mean and low Condition, unleſs it be becauſe all their thoughts are indifferently and baſely approv'd? So the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation we give our Friends, perſwades them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that they have more Senſe than others; which makes them Proud, Bold, Imprudent, and capable of falling into the preſent Errors without perceiving it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore our Enemies are often kinder to us, and inform our Underſtanding more by their Oppoſitions, than our Friends by their Approbations; becauſe our Enemies oblige us to ſtand upon our Guard, and to be Attentive to what we urge; which alone is capable to make us ſenſible of our Errors. But our Friends Lull us aſleep, and gives us a falſe Confidence, which makes us vain and ignorant. Men therefore muſt never ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire their Friends, and ſubmit to their Sentiments out of kindneſs, as they muſt never oppoſe thoſe of their Enemies out of Malice, but muſt lay aſide the Spirit of Flattery or Contradiction to become ſincere, and approve Evidence and Truth where-ever they find it.</p>
                  <p>We ought alſo to be fully perſwaded, that moſt Men are inclin'd to Flatter and Compliment us, out of a kind of Natural Inclination, to appear Witty, to gain the good Will of others, and in hopes of ſome return; or finally, out of a kind of Scorn and Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; and we ought never to ſuffer our ſelves to be impos'd upon, by whatever can be ſaid to us. Do we not daily ſee that Perſons who know not each other, nevertheleſs extol one another to the Skies, the very firſt time they ſee and ſpeak to one another? And what is more common than to ſee ſome who give hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolical praiſes, and expreſs extraordinary motions of admiration to a Perſon that has ſpoken in publick; even in the preſence of thoſe with whom they have laugh'd at him a little before. Whenever People Cry out, and grow Pale with admiration, and ſeem as it were aſtoniſh'd at what they hear, it is not a good proof that he that ſpeaks ſays Wonders; but rather
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60613:255"/>that he ſpeaks to Flatterers, that he has Friends, or perhaps Enemies who Laugh at him. It is becauſe he ſpeaks in an engaging Way, that he is Rich and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, or if you will have it ſo, it is a pretty good proof that what he ſays is grounded upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and Obſcure Notions of the Senſes, but very moving and very agreeable, or that he has a Lively Imagination, ſince praiſes are given to Friendſhip, Riches, Dignities, Probabilities, and very ſeldom to Truth.</p>
                  <p>It may be expected perhaps, that having treated in general of the Inclinations of the Mind, I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to an exact Account of all the particular Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they reſent at the ſight of Good and Evil, <hi>viz.</hi> That I ſhould explain the Nature of Love, Hatred, Joy and Sadneſs, and of all Intellectual Paſſions both general and particular, as well Simple as Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But I have not engag'd to Explain all the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent motions the Mind is capable of.</p>
                  <p>I am willing it ſhould be known that my principal Deſign in all that I have written hitherto about a Search after Truth, has been to make Men ſenſible of their Weakneſs and Ignorance; and that we are all liable to Error and Sin. I have ſaid it, and ſay it again, perhaps ſome will remember it: My Deſign never was to give a particular Account of the Nature of the Mind: But I have been oblig'd to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about it, to explain Errors in their Original, and in order; in a word, to make my ſelf more Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: And if I have gone beyond the Bounds I had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, it is becauſe I thought I had ſome new things to ſay, which ſeem'd to me of Conſequence, and which I thought might be read with Pleaſure. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I was miſtaken; but that preſumption was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to encourage me to write them. For how can one ſpeak, without hopes of being hearken'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? The Truth is, I have ſaid many things which do not ſeem to belong ſo much to the Subject I am treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, as that particular of the Motions of the Soul: I own it, but it is not my Intention to oblige my ſelf
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60613:256"/>to any thing, when I preſcribe a Method to my ſelf. I lay down a Rule to guide me, but I reſerve to my ſelf the power of turning aſide from it as I walk, if I meet with any thing that deſerves to be conſider'd. I may leave the way ſometimes to reſt my ſelf, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided I do not loſe my ſelf. Thoſe who have not a Mind to ſtop with me, may go on, if they pleaſe, 'tis but turning over the Leaf: But if they are offended at it, let them know there are many who believe thoſe places which I have pitch'd upon to reſt in, make them find the Way the eaſier and more delightful.</p>
